Hurricane (Westend song)
"Hurricane" was the Austrian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983, performed in German by Westend.
The song was performed eighteenth on the night, following Portugal's Armando Gama with "Esta balada que te dou" and preceding Belgium's Pas de Deux with "Rendez-vous". At the close of voting, it had received 53 points, placing 9th in a field of 20 entries.
The song is an up-tempo number, in which the band sings about being without the object of their affections and likens this condition to being in a hurricane.
It was succeeded as Austrian representative in the 1984 contest by Anita singing "Einfach weg".
