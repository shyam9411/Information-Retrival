Toronto RCAF Hurricanes
The Toronto RCAF Hurricanes was a member of the Ontario Rugby Football Union and was formed during the Second World War after several teams disbanded for the war. The team was composed of football players who had joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. The team won the 30th Grey Cup in 1942.
Fifteen members of the team went on to operational service with the RCAF in Europe during the war.[1] Seven of those men were killed in combat: Eddie Thompson, Lloyd Langley, Ed Poscavage, Eddie Burton, Jack Buckmaster, George Oliphant and Bob Sarvis.[2]
