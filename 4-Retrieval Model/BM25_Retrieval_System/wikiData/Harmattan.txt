Harmattan
The Harmattan is a season in the West African subcontinent, which occurs between the end of November and the middle of March. It is characterized by dry[1] and dusty northeasterly trade wind, of the same name, which blows from the Sahara Desert over West Africa into the Gulf of Guinea.[2] The name comes from or is related to Ga haramata.[3] It is cold[1] in most places, but can be hot[4] in some places, depending on circumstances.[5]
The Harmattan blows during the dry season, which occurs during the lowest-sun months, when the subtropical ridge of high pressure stays over the central Sahara Desert and when the low-pressure Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) stays over the Gulf of Guinea. On its passage over the Sahara, it picks up fine dust and sand particles (between 0.5 and 10 microns).


Effects[edit]
The Harmattan season differs from winter, because it is characterized by cold, dry, dust-laden wind, and also wide ﬂuctuations in the ambient temperatures of the day and night. Temperatures can easily be as low as 9 °C (48 °F) all day, but sometimes in the afternoon the temperature can also soar to as high as 30 °C (86 °F), while the relative humidity drops under 10%.
The air is particularly dry and desiccating when the Harmattan blows over the region.[1] The Harmattan brings desert-like weather conditions: it lowers the humidity, dissipates cloud cover, prevents rainfall formation and sometimes creates big clouds of dust which can result in dust storms or sandstorms.[citation needed] The wind can increase fire risk[6] and cause severe crop damage.[7] The interaction of the Harmattan with monsoon winds can cause tornadoes.[2]
Harmattan haze[edit]
In some countries in West Africa, the heavy amount of dust in the air can severely limit visibility and block the sun for several days,[8] comparable to a heavy fog. This effect is known as the Harmattan haze. It costs airlines millions of dollars in cancelled and diverted flights each year.[9][10] When the haze is weak, the skies are clear.[11][12] The dry air can break the trunks of trees growing in the region.Template:Https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=aqNKAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=dry+air+Harmattan+breaks+tree+trunks&source=bl&ots=ZaEHZckrlp&sig=Yt mg5tpRoCUM57rCB2M5ozy2jA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj jcyI25XXAhUGlZQKHeZ5Bv8Q6AEIPjAF
Health[edit]
Humidity drops to as low as 15%, which can result in spontaneous nosebleeds for some people.[7] Other health effects on humans may include conditions of the skin, eyes, and respiratory system, including aggravation of asthma.[13]
