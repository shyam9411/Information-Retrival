South Atlantic High
South Atlantic High is a semipermanent pressure high centered at about 25°S, 15°W, in the Atlantic Ocean. It is also called the St. Helena High. It can stretch thousands of miles across the South Atlantic affecting shipping. Sailors try to find a "corridor" through using the low-pressure systems forming off the coast of Brazil that move west pushing against the high pressure.
