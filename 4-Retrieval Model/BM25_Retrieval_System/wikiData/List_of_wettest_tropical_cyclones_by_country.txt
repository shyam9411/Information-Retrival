List of wettest tropical cyclones by country
This is a list of wettest tropical cyclones by country, using all known available sources. Data is most complete for Australia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Mexico, Taiwan, Yap, Chuuk, and the United States, with fragmentary data available for other countries. The French region of Réunion holds several world records for tropical cyclone and worldwide rainfall, due to the rough topography and its proximity to the Indian Ocean.[1]
Below are the records for each country above.


Antigua and Barbuda[edit]
Australia[edit]
Christmas Island[edit]
Christmas Island is an Australian territory located in the Indian Ocean located at the summit of a submarine mountain, which rises steeply to a central plateau that is dominated by stands of rainforest.[14] After rainfall and wind observations started on the island during 1972, only 13 tropical cyclones passed within 220 km (135 mi) of the territory between 1972 and 2005.[14]
Cocos Islands[edit]
The Cocos (Keeling) Islands are an Australian territory of 27 coral islands that are formed into two large coral atolls and cover an area of around 36 km2 (14 sq mi) of the Indian Ocean to the northwest of Perth, Australia.[14] Rainfall observations started on the islands during 1907, while temperature, wind and other records started in 1952.[14] Between 1952 and 2005 27 tropical cyclones caused storm force wind gusts of over 90 km/h (55 mph) on the islands, while only four caused hurricane-force gusts of over 125 km/h (80 mph).[14]
Bahamas[edit]
Bangladesh[edit]
Bangladesh has been the scene of the greatest tropical cyclone casualties in recent times. The country is quite flat and generally lies near sea level.
Belize[edit]
This country has terrain mainly across its southern sections, with elevations up to about 3,700 feet (1,100 m).[48] The highest reported rainfall in what was formerly British Honduras occurred during Hurricane Keith in 2000 when 32.67 inches (830 mm) of rain fell in a 24‑hour period at Phillip Goodson International Airport in Belize City.[49] It should be noted that equally heavy rains could have fallen during Hurricane Hattie of 1961 and Hurricane Fifi of 1974.
Cambodia[edit]
Canada[edit]
Tropical cyclones are usually in transition to extratropical cyclones by the time they reach Atlantic Canada, though occasionally they retain their tropical status. No tropical cyclone has ever hit Canada's Pacific coast.
China[edit]
China is a mountainous country, which leads to rapid dissipation of cyclones that move inland as well as significant amounts of rain from those dissipating cyclones. Typhoon Nina (1975) caused the collapse of two huge reservoirs and ten smaller dams when 1,062 millimetres (41.8 in) fell in Henan during a 24‑hour period, which is the record for Mainland China. Typhoon Sam of the 1999 Pacific typhoon season became the wettest known tropical cyclone to impact Hong Kong since records began in 1884, breaking a 73‑year‑old record.[70] Precipitation associated with tropical cyclones and their remains can bring snow to Tibet. An early October 2004 tropical depression brought daily precipitation of 6 centimetres (2.4 in) of liquid equivalent precipitation to Che-Ku county in the form of heavy snow, which was a new October daily precipitation record for both rain and snow. This led to a loss of 340,000 kg of food, 230,000 kg of forage grass, and 263 livestock in the snowstorm.[42]
Mainland[edit]
Hong Kong[edit]
Taiwan/Taipei[edit]
The mountainous island of Taiwan province experiences an average of 1.8 tropical cyclone landfalls each year.[80] Due to its rugged topography, Taiwan sees extreme rains from tropical cyclones, particularly in its central mountain range.
Costa Rica[edit]
Cuba[edit]
Hurricane Flora of October 1963 drifted across Cuba for four days, leading to extreme rainfall across the mountainous island country. During the heaviest 24‑hour period of rainfall, 735 millimetres (28.9 in) of rain fell at Santiago de Cuba. Total amounts of 2,033 millimetres (80.0 in) over 4 days and 2,550 millimetres (100 in) over 5 days produced staggering loss of life in Cuba, where over 2000 perished.[95]
Dominica[edit]
The islands of the eastern Caribbean are constantly threatened by tropical storms and hurricanes, mainly between August and October. Dominica is a rugged island, with spots of elevation as high as nearly 4,750 feet (1,450 m).[96] As Hurricane Jeanne moved through the region, 422.3 millimetres (16.63 in) of rain fell during the 24‑hour period ending on the morning of September 15, 2004.[40]
Dominican Republic[edit]
The Dominican Republic, has some of the highest terrain surrounding the Caribbean Sea, with Pico Duarte peaking at 10,700 feet (3,300 m) above sea level.[100] Most of the tropical cyclone rainfall totals on the list below are 24‑hour maxima, which likely underrepresent the storm total.
El Salvador[edit]
Federated States of Micronesia[edit]
Chuuk[edit]
Elevations of the islands surrounding Chuuk lagoon reach a height of about 1,450 feet (440 m).[111] Typhoon Chataan led to excessive rainfall on this island from June 23 – July 3, 2002, when a total of 939 mm (37.0 in) fell. During the time frame when Chataan was declared a tropical cyclone from July 1–3, 622 mm (24.5 in) fell, with 506 mm (19.9 in) falling on the 2nd alone at the international airport.[112]
Kosrae[edit]
Pohnpei State[edit]
The state is mountainous island lies in the tropical northwest Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei State
Yap State[edit]
The wettest known tropical cyclone for the state was Ruby in 1982, which drifted in the island's vicinity for several days during its initial development phase.[116]
Fiji[edit]
Orography from the volcanic islands of Fiji has led to significant rainfall during tropical cyclone passages, which occur roughly once a year.
France[edit]
French Polynesia[edit]
Guadeloupe[edit]
Hurricane Marilyn moved directly across the island in mid-September 1995,[132] bringing the highest known rainfall totals to the island from a tropical cyclone.
Martinique[edit]
Martinique is a mountainous island at the fringe of the eastern Caribbean Sea.
New Caledonia[edit]
Réunion Island[edit]
The mountainous island of Réunion has experienced several of the highest rainfall totals on record from tropical cyclones and holds the rainfall world records for 12, 24, 48, 72 hours, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten days as a result.[149][150][151] The 12 and 24 hourly rainfall records were set at Foc-Foc by Cyclone Denise in 1966, while an Unnamed Tropical Cyclone between April 8–10, 1958 set the record for 48 hours at Aurere. Tropical Cyclone Gamede between February 24–28, 2007 came close to beating the records for 12, 24 and 48 hours before setting the records for three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine days that were held by Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe 1980.[150][151] Hyacinthe 1980 currently holds the world records for ten and fifteen days with rainfall totals of 5,678 millimetres (223.5 in) and 6,083 millimetres (239.5 in) respectively recorded at Commerson Crater.[151][152]
Saint Martin[edit]
Wallis and Futuna[edit]
Great Britain[edit]
Anguilla[edit]
Bermuda[edit]
Bermuda has not historically received overwhelming rains out of tropical cyclones. This could be because of the rapid pace storms usually pass the island and the lack of mountains on the island.
Cayman Islands[edit]
Guatemala[edit]
Tropical Storm Agatha in May 2010 became the second-wettest tropical cyclone in the nation's history when it slowly developed while remaining nearly stationary to the southwest of Guatemala, before turning northeast and dissipating across inland Central America.[178]
Haiti[edit]
Haiti that makes up three-eighths of Hispaniola,[184][185] is a mountainous country that has experienced some of the most powerful hurricanes on record, including Hurricane David. Its three mountain ranges have peaks as high as 8793 feet/2680 meters above sea level.[186]
Honduras[edit]
Swan Island[edit]
India[edit]
India can be struck by cyclones that form in the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea.
Indonesia[edit]
The precursor tropical disturbance of Tropical Cyclone Inigo in April 2003 dropped heavy rainfall in eastern Indonesia. The rainfall caused flash flooding and mudslides, primarily in Flores but also on West Timor[206] and Sumba.[207] In some locations, the depth of the floodwaters reached 5 metres (16 ft). The Oessao River in West Timor exceeded its banks, which flooded seven villages. In Kupang in West Timor, the system destroyed hundreds of homes and large fields of corn, bean, and rice crop. Heavy damage was reported near Ende, where flooding and mudslides destroyed 20 houses and destroyed the roads connecting to East Flores. The city airport was flooded with one meter (3 ft) of water, preventing aerial transportation and which left the city temporarily isolated. In East Flores Regency in eastern Flores Island, the system left 75 destroyed houses, along with 77 severely damaged and a further 56 receiving light damage.[206]
