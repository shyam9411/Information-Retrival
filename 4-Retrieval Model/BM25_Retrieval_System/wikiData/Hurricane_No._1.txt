History[edit]
Formation, Hurricane No. 1 and Only the Strongest Will Survive (1996–99)[edit]
Wishing to perform the later-day sound of his former band Ride, vocalist/guitarist Andy Bell formed Hurricane No. 1.[1] Signed to Creation Records (along with fellow bands such as Oasis, The Jesus and Mary Chain and Primal Scream) they released their debut album in 1997, entitled Hurricane #1. This included their first single, "Step into My World", which reached number 29 in the UK Singles Chart (and a Paul Oakenfold remix of which reached number 19 in 1997),[2] and other less successful singles "Just Another Illusion" and "Chain Reaction".
In 1999, follow-up album Only the Strongest Will Survive spawned the band's other highest charting single, also called "Only the Strongest Will Survive". The song reached number 19 in 1998.[2]
Break up (1999–2014)[edit]
In 1999, Bell parted ways with Hurricane No. 1, joining Gay Dad on guitar.[3] Shortly after joining Gay Dad, Bell split from the band to become the bass player for Oasis. In 2004, a double disc compilation of their songs was released, entitled Step into My World.
Former Hurricane No. 1 vocalist / guitarist, Lowe has pursued a solo career, and has released three albums to date. In 2007, Lowe announced a new project called Garage Flowers, and a single, "Where To Begin", was released via iTunes.
Reformation (2014–present)[edit]
In November 2014, it was announced that Hurricane No. 1 had reunited without Bell.[4] The line-up, fronted by Lowe,[4] featured Carlo Mariani on guitar, Lucas Mariani has now been replaced by Chris Mullin on bass and Chris Campbell on drums.[5] The band's third album, Find What You Love and Let It Kill You, was released on 26 November 2015 through German-based label Tapete.[6] Bell features "Think of the Sunshine".[7] Lowe wrote the album while he was undergoing treatment for cancer in hospital.[7] Lowe explained that "When you are wired up to chemo and radio therapy, the last thing you want to do is wallow in it and feel sorry for yourself so I had the idea that the album should be happy and not too dark."[7]
Melodic Rainbows, the band's fourth album, was released on 12 October 2016[8] in Japan. The album will be released in the UK in November 2017. [9] The band are set to play Beano on the Sea festival in September[10] and the Shiine On Weekender in November.[11] The band are set to embark on a tour early 2018 and will also releasing another album..
