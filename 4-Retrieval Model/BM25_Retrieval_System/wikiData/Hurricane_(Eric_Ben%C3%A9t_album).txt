Recording[edit]
Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations, including the Hit Factory in New York, New York, Bowery Digital, Chalice Studios, Ocean Way Studio, The Studio, Warner Bros. Sound Stage, and Westlake Audio in Los Angeles, California, Chartmaker Studios, Drew's Groove Studios, Panic Room, and Soundstage Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, Jade Studios and Jupiter Studios in Franklin, Tennessee, and Eastman Scoring Stage in Burbank, California.[2] Production was handled by Benét and several other record producers, including Walter Afanasieff, Michael Carney, Hod David, Dave Foster, George Nash, Jr., and Demonté Posey.[6]
Composition[edit]
Hurricane incorporates musical elements of gospel and contributions from jazz musicians Roy Hargrove, Chris Botti, and Viktor Krauss.[4] A departure from the jazzy, groove-based urban sound of Benét's previous work, the album features an adult contemporary radio format style, with sweeping strings, layered vocals, and nimble acoustic guitars.[7] According to Rashod D. Ollison of The Washington Post, "Hurricane is lush in spots, the overall sound more in the adult contemporary vein. More Christopher Cross, less R. Kelly".[7]
Reception[edit]
Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars and commented that "The quiet storm is well performed but dull, yet the Prince-styled numbers are engaging, melodic, and nimble, strong showcases for Benet's mellow skills".[1] Mojo gave the album three out of five stars and called it "a very palatable collection of self-penned confessional songs".[2] Laura Checkoway of Vibe called it "an uneven mix of simplistic sentimentality", stating "Reflective and repentant at times, Hurricane is more likely to sing you to sleep than knock you off your feet".[3] The Washington Post commented favorably on the album's themes of "healing and redemption", and stated "The spiritual tone often brings out the best in [Eric Benet]'s supple tenor on 'In The End' and other tracks".[4]
