Hurricane Festival
The Hurricane Festival, also just Hurricane, is a music festival that takes place in Scheeßel near Bremen, Germany, usually every June. The festival and its guests are generally associated with the alternative part of mainstream music, although the festival has been becoming more and more mainstream over the years.
The Southside Festival, often referred to as the "sister" of Hurricane, takes place on the same three days in the very south of Germany (contrary to Hurricane, which is in the north). Together they are a twin festival, since they are on the same days and usually have the same lineup with only few exceptions.


History[edit]
In 1973, the first festival was held in Scheeßel, the place where today's Hurricane takes place. It was called "Es rockt in der Heide" at that time (literally translated: It's rocking in the heath) and was attended by 52,000 people.
At the "First Rider Open Air" in 1977, fans caused damage of more than a million marks when riots broke out, because only five of the announced 23 bands could perform—a huge scandal was uncovered few days later, forcing the organizing management to discontinue their festivals in Scheeßel.
In 1997 rock returned to Scheeßel in the form of the Hurricane Festival, with numerous bands performing in front of 20,000 visitors. It has taken place on the Eichenring, a motorcycle sand racetrack, ever since. Audience size peaked in 2008 with about 75,000 guests; from 2002 to 2006 between 40,000 and 60,000 people came. In 2003, the festival was extended from two to three days. In 2007 60,000 and in 2008 70.000 tickets were sold.[1]
In 2004 David Bowie suffered from chest pain. He was flown to the AK Altona by helicopter after finishing the show. There he was diagnosed with a heart attack.[2] This has been his final full concert.
