Hurricane, Bollinger County, Missouri
Hurricane is an unincorporated community in the eastern part of Crooked Creek Township in Bollinger County, Missouri. The community is located near Hurricane Creek, a nearby stream. Hurricane was named after Hurricane Creek. The name derives from the creek’s unusual swiftness and violence after heavy rains, which makes passage across the creek impossible or dangerous. The violence of this swiftness and speed is likened to a storm or hurricane.[1] A post office was in operation between the years 1894-1942.[2]
