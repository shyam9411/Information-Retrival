Houston Hurricanes FC
Houston Hurricanes FC is an American soccer club based in Houston, Texas. Hurricanes FC was established in December 2012 when the league announced that team owner Brendan Keyes was moving his Galveston Pirate SC franchise to Houston.
The Hurricanes' regular kit colors are green and white horizontally striped shirts with white shorts and socks which derive from the iconic Celtic F.C. uniform.


History[edit]
National Premier Soccer League (NPSL)[edit]
On December 24, 2012, the National Premier Soccer League announced that Galveston Pirate SC team owner Brendan Keyes would relocate and rebrand his franchise for the 2013 NPSL season.[1] The Pirates, who won the South Central Conference crown as an expansion team in 2012, will continue to play in local leagues and tournaments in Texas, while the new Houston Hurricanes will take the place of the Galveston team in the NPSL.
In the 1990s Keyes played for the Houston Hurricanes (USISL); his boyhood idol Bobby Lennox played for the NASL's Hurricane club in 1978-79, two factors that played into Keyes resurrecting the Hurricane brand. The move received the blessing of NPSL Chairman Andy Zorovich and former Hurricane owner Joey Serralta.[2]
On the same day of the announcement of their relocation, the club also revealed their first player signing, which was 19-year-old Mercer University player Justin Ross. The Hurricanes then held tryouts in order to fill the rest of their roster before their NPSL debut in May 2013. The Hurricanes finished the 2013 NPSL season in last place in the South Central Conference.
On November 11, 2013, owner Brendan Keyes announced that the club would not be participating in the NPSL the following season, instead focusing on growing the new TPSL.
Texas Premier Soccer League[edit]
In September 2013 the Hurricanes joined five other Texas-based clubs (BCS Bearkatz FC, Galveston Pirate SC, Houston Dutch Lions, Houston Hurricanes FC, Houston Leones FC, Houston Regals SCA) forming the Texas Premier Soccer League.[3]
