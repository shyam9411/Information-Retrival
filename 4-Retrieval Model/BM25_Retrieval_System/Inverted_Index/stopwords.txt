# My stopwords list consist of two parts: 1. stopwords in English and 2. field words

# For the select of stopwords in English, I use the API in NLTK:nk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')
# to make a intersection set with my top frequency terms (refer to unigram_term_frequency_table.txt).
# And the word list stops when there is some word, which is not in English stopwords in NLTK, appears
# in my term frequency table (in my case, it is 'hurricane'). These words selected are regarded as
# common but useless words in searching. Since we should be really careful about the construction of
# stopwords list in case of information missing, I don't put too many words in my list.

# For the select of field words, it need to combine some page analysis and web domain knowledge.
# The word 'click', 'here', 'privacy' are all common to be used as anchor text. and the word
# 'reference', 'references', 'see', 'also', 'edit' are all key words of wiki article framework.
# Finally, I found several Chinese terms which can be regarded as the translations of certain
# punctuations. For example, '逗号' in Chinese means ','. So I add these words into stopwords list too.
