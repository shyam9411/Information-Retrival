Hurricane Mesa
Hurricane Mesa (37°14′25″N 113°12′41″W﻿ / ﻿37.24028°N 113.21139°W﻿ / 37.24028; -113.21139[1]) is a Utah landform near Hurricane, Utah, used for Cold War tests of rocket ejection seats for supersonic aircraft at the Hurricane Supersonic Research Site.[2] The mesa is "flat bedrock of faultless Shinarump conglomerate" 1,500 ft (460 m) above the Virgin River valley, which allowed clearance for assessment of a longer flight trajectory up from the mesa and over the cliff for the test object (e.g., the anthropoid simulator--dummy--named "Hurricane Sam").
Currently the facility is still used to test military ejection seats for the US and Foreign Govt's.
