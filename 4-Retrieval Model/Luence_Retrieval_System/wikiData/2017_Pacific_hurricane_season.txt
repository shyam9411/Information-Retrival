2017 Pacific hurricane season
The 2017 Pacific hurricane season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific; they will both end on November 30.[1] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin. However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. This was demonstrated when the first storm, Tropical Storm Adrian, was named on May 10, and became the earliest-known tropical storm in the East Pacific since the advent of satellite imagery. Thus far, the season has seen near-average activity in terms of ACE, in stark contrast to the extremely active seasons in 2014, 2015, and 2016. For the third year in a row, the season featured above average activity in July, with the ACE value being the fifth highest for the month. However, as of November 5, no tropical cyclones have formed in the Central Pacific. If the season ends without a tropical cyclone forming there, it would be the first time since 2012 that this happened. Despite being very active, the season featured the weakest storms since the 2013 season, with the strongest storm only dropping to 947 millibars.
Beginning this year, the National Hurricane Center has the option to issue advisories, and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued, on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one, and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48 hours. Such systems are classified as "Potential Tropical Cyclones". Advisories on these storms contain the same content, including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings, as advisories on active tropical cyclones.[2] This was first demonstrated on August 29 with the designation of Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen-E—which later developed into Tropical Storm Lidia—south-southeast of the Baja California Peninsula.


Seasonal forecasts
On May 25, 2017, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its annual forecast, predicting a 80% chance of a near- to above-average season in both the Eastern and Central Pacific basins, with a total of 14–20 named storms, 6–11 hurricanes, and 3–7 major hurricanes.[nb 1][5] During May 28, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) issued its first forecast for the season, predicting a total of 16 named storms, 10 hurricanes and 6 major hurricanes to develop.[6]
Seasonal summary
The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) for the 2017 Pacific hurricane season, as of Selma's final advisory, is 98.0225 units (97.09 units from the East Pacific and 0.9325 units from the Central Pacific).[nb 2]
Although the East Pacific hurricane season does not officially begin until May 15, activity began several days prior with the formation of a tropical depression on May 9. This marked the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone in the basin, surpassing 1990's Hurricane Alma.[7] It intensified into Tropical Storm Adrian a few hours later, marking the earliest formation of a named storm on record.[8] Near normal activity occurred in June, with Tropical Storm Calvin formed on June 11, and Hurricane Dora on June 25.[9] For the third year in a row, July featured above average activity, with the fifth highest ACE value for that month on record. [10] This total was attributed to long lived hurricanes Eugene, Fernanda, Hilary and Irwin. August saw significantly less activity, with only three storms forming in the month; however it featured Hurricane Kenneth, the third major hurricane of the season. September featured four storms, including Hurricane Otis, which became the fourth major hurricane of the season. Activity slowed considerably during the end of the month, only two storms formed after September 23, both of which did not attain hurricane intensity. After Ramon dissipated on October 5, activity ceased with no further storms forming until Tropical Storm Selma, which formed in late October.[citation needed]
Systems
Tropical Storm Adrian
On May 5, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated that an area of low pressure was forecast to form south of Mexico over subsequent days, with the possibility of tropical cyclone development thereafter.[11] A broad cyclonic circulation began to develop as expected late on May 7,[12] gradually organizing into the season's first tropical depression by 21:00 UTC on May 9.[13] Upon formation, at which point it was located about 545 mi (875 km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico, the depression became the earliest-forming East Pacific tropical cyclone (east of 140°W) on record. The previous record was held by 1990's Hurricane Alma, which formed on May 12.[7] The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Adrian six hours later, the earliest-known formation of a named storm in eastern Pacific proper since the advent of the satellite era.[14] Initially, forecasts expected the small storm to intensify into a powerful hurricane. Shortly after reaching peak intensity early on May 10, an unexpected increase in mid-level wind shear caused Adrian to quickly weaken back to a tropical depression by 03:00 UTC on May 11.[15] Early on the next day, Adrian degenerated into a remnant low.[16]
Tropical Storm Beatriz
A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on May 18 and entered the East Pacific about a week later, where steady organization led to the formation of a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on May 31. Embedded within southwesterly flow around a large upper-level trough across northern Mexico, the depression moved steadily northeast in a favorable environment, and it intensified into Tropical Storm Beatriz by 06:00 UTC on June 1. After attaining peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), the system made landfall around 00:00 UTC on June 2 about 25 miles (40 km) west of Puerto Ángel. The mountainous terrain of Mexico quickly disrupted Beatriz, and it ultimately dissipated twelve hours later.[17]
In the state of Oaxaca, flights out of Bahías de Huatulco International Airport were cancelled, and schools were closed until at least June 3. Dozens of roads were rendered impassable due to mudslides and flooding; numerous locales received over 4 in (102 mm) of rain, with a storm total of 19.07 in (484.4 mm) in Huatulco.[17] Numerous landslides caused significant disruption across the state, especially by blocking Federal Highway 200 at many areas. A landslide in San Marcial Ozolotepec killed two girls and buried several houses, while another in San Carlos Yautepec killed a woman.[18] As of June 4, a total of seven people have been killed—five in Oaxaca and two in Tehuantepec.[19] Less than two weeks after Beatriz, Tropical Storm Calvin affected similar areas of Mexico and inflicted additional damage. Combined damage from the two systems reached at least 70 million pesos (US$3.9 million) in Oaxaca.[20]
Tropical Storm Calvin
In the second week of June, the NHC forecast the development of a broad area of low pressure a few hundred miles south of Mexico over the next several days.[21] This prediction came to fruition on June 9,[22] and the fledgling disturbance steadily organized into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on June 11 while located about 150 mi (240 km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz.[23] It was slow to organize initially amid moderate easterly wind shear as it drifted northwestwards;[24] by 18:00 UTC on June 12, however, the tropical depression intensified into Tropical Storm Calvin.[23] Intensifying slightly to reach winds of 45 mph (75 km/h),[23] Calvin made landfall halfway between Salina Cruz and Puerto Ángel, near Paja Blanca, around 00:00 UTC on June 13.[25] Just 12 hours later, Calvin dissipated into a remnant low.[23] The remnants of the storm caused heavy rainfall and some flooding in the area,[26] however no fatalities were reported.[23]
Hurricane Dora
On June 21, the NHC began monitoring a broad area of low pressure south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec for possible tropical cyclogenesis.[27] The disturbance organized into a tropical depression by 03:00 UTC on June 25,[28] and became a tropical storm six hours later, receiving the name Dora.[29] Progressing in a west-northwesterly direction at a steady speed, the storm began a 30-hour period of rapid intensification and became the first hurricane of the season at 09:00 UTC on June 26.[30] With impressive upper-level outflow and an eye apparent on satellite imagery,[31] the storm attained peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) by late on June 26.[32] Dora maintained its intensity for a number of hours before beginning to rapidly weaken over cooler sea surface temperatures and in an environment of drier air.[33] The storm later degenerated into a remnant low early on June 28, after all of the storm's deep convection had dissipated.[34]
The outer bands of Dora brought heavy rains to Guerrero, resulting in flash floods that inundated 20 homes. Overall damage was minor, however.[35]
Hurricane Eugene
Hurricane Eugene developed from a disturbance located 765 mi (1,230 km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula on July 7.[36] On the following day, Eugene underwent a period of rapid intensification; in an 18-hour period starting at 21:00 UTC on July 8, Eugene intensified from a tropical storm with 70 mph (110 km/h) winds to a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph (185 km/h) winds, making it the first major hurricane of the season.[37][38] However, by 12 hours later, the entrainment of dry air caused Eugene to weaken to a Category 2 hurricane,[39] and due to traveling over cooler waters, Eugene weakened to a tropical storm on the following day.[40] As the coverage of deep convection steadily dwindled, Eugene fell to tropical depression intensity around 15:00 UTC on July 12 and degenerated to a remnant low six hours later.[41][42]
Dangerous rip currents combined with swells of 4 to 8 ft (1.2 to 2.4 m) across southern California resulted in hundreds of rescues. On July 10 alone, lifeguards in Huntington Beach made 200 rescues while 600 were made in Los Angeles County; lifeguards also responded to 700 medical emergencies.[43]
Hurricane Fernanda
Late on July 10, the NHC began monitoring a broad area of low pressure several hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo. Contrary to predictions of gradual development,[44] the disturbance rapidly organized into a tropical depression by 03:00 UTC on July 12,[45] and further strengthened to become Tropical Storm Fernanda around 15:00 UTC that day.[46] The nascent cyclone initially battled moderate northeasterly wind shear, with its low-level circulation displaced to the northeastern edge of the deep convection.[47] This period of unfavorable upper-level winds was short-lived, and soon afterwards Fernanda commenced a period of rapid intensification, intensifying into a hurricane at 21:00 UTC on July 13.[48] A well-defined eye formed within a growing central dense overcast, and Fernanda further intensified into a major hurricane early on July 14.[49] Only six hours later, the system was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane.[50] At 10.9°N, Fernanda became the second strongest hurricane to occur at such a low latitude in the Eastern Pacific, only behind 2015's Hurricane Olaf.[51]
With expansive upper-level outflow and spiral bands, a distinct eye, and a symmetric central dense overcast, Fernanda attained peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) around 03:00 UTC on July 15.[52] A series of microwave passes around that time began to indicate the formation of a secondary eyewall that halted the cyclone's development as it tracked west-northwest to northwest.[53] The eyewall replacement cycle concluded early on July 16, allowing Fernanda to remain a powerful hurricane amid favorable environmental conditions.[54] By late on July 18, however, cooler ocean temperatures and a more stable environment prompted the storm's weakening trend.[55] Fernanda fell below hurricane intensity shortly before entering the Central Pacific as it succumbed to stronger southwesterly wind shear,[56] and after failing to produce sustained deep convection, degenerated to a remnant low about 500 miles (805 km) east of Hilo, Hawaii, by 21:00 UTC on July 22.[57]
Tropical Storm Greg
On July 12, the NHC forecast the formation of a broad area of low pressure south of Mexico over subsequent days.[58] The disturbance formed two days later and slowly organized into a tropical depression by 15:00 UTC on July 17.[59][60] The cyclone battled strong west-northwesterly wind shear after formation, intensifying into Tropical Storm Greg by 09:00 UTC on July 18 as deep convection burst near the center, but remained steady state for several days thereafter despite continued predictions of intensification.[61][62] Ultimately, given global models' poor handling of the environment, NHC lowered their intensity forecast for Greg.[63] The cyclone continued west for the remainder of its life and maintained a similar convective structure, with intermittent bursts of deep convection near the center.[64] Approaching the Central Pacific, Greg's low-level circulation became increasingly difficult to locate as it moved into a cooler, drier environment intertwined by increasing southerly wind shear, and the system weakened to a tropical depression around 21:00 UTC on July 25.[65] It degenerated to a remnant low 24 hours later.[66]
Tropical Depression Eight-E
A low-pressure trough began producing disorganized convection over the waters of the Pacific Ocean, well to the south of Baja California Peninsula, on July 14.[67] Despite only marginally conducive environmental conditions, the disturbance began to show signs of organization two days later,[68] and it attained tropical depression status by 15:00 UTC on July 18.[69] Strong west-northwesterly wind shear confined the storm's intermittent bursts of convection well to the southwest of its low-level circulation, and the depression consequently failed to produce winds above 35 mph (55 km/h).[70] The system's center later degenerated into a low-pressure trough within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories at 21:00 UTC on July 20.[71]
Hurricane Hilary
Part of an exceptionally active July, the NHC began highlighting the far eastern reaches of the Pacific basin on July 19 for tropical development in later days.[72] A large area of disturbed weather progressed westward across Costa Rica later that day,[73] steadily organizing into a tropical depression by 15:00 UTC on July 21.[74] The cyclone failed to organize immediately after formation, and its low-level center migrated to the southern extent of associated convection.[75] By 03:00 UTC on July 23, though, better defined banding features and a more organized convective structure led the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Hilary.[76] Over the coming hours, the cyclone's convective structure evolved into a small central dense overcast while hints of an eye became apparent;[77] in accordance with satellite estimates, Hilary was upgraded to a hurricane at 09:00 UTC on July 24.[78] A moist environment and warm ocean waters propelled Hilary to its peak as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) 24 hours later, at which time its core was most symmetric.[79] After maintaining its intensity, the hurricane began to weaken late on July 26 as northerly wind shear increased.[80] It fell back to tropical storm intensity around 03:00 UTC on July 27 and ultimately degenerated to a remnant low four days later.[81][82]
Hurricane Irwin
On July 16, the NHC highlighted the expected formation of an area of low pressure south of Mexico later that week.[83] A tropical wave began producing disorganized cloudiness three days later,[72] and the broad system slowly organized into a tropical depression by 15:00 UTC on July 22.[84] Its structure changed little after formation, impinged by strong wind shear; despite this, satellite wind data indicated the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Irwin by 09:00 UTC on July 23.[85] Over the next 24 hours, deep convection began to wrap around the center and a mid-level eye formed as environmental conditions improved;[86] by 09:00 UTC on July 25, Irwin intensified into a hurricane.[87] Although coolest cloudtops were located in the western semicircle of the system, a well-defined eye and convection in the eyewall propelled Irwin to its peak with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) late on July 25.[88] Almost immediately, outflow from nearby Hurricane Hilary increased wind shear over the system and caused it to begin weakening;[89] Irwin rapidly fell to tropical storm strength around 15:00 UTC on July 26.[90] Contrary to projections of continued weakening, however, the storm's cloud pattern maintained or even improved over subsequent days as it passed over marginal ocean temperatures.[91] Finally, after losing its deep convection and being reduced to a swirl of low-level clouds, Irwin was declared a remnant low around 21:00 UTC on August 1.[92]
Tropical Depression Eleven-E
On July 28, the NHC advertised the likely development of an area of low pressure well south of Mexico over subsequent days.[93] An area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave materialized three days later, but little change occurred thereafter.[94] Early on August 3, a surface circulation formed in association with concentrating convection,[95] and this process led to the formation of a tropical depression by 15:00 UTC the next day.[96] The newly formed cyclone did not intensify after designation, and its low- and mid-level circulations separated by over 265 mi (425 km) on August 5.[97] Falling short of the tropical cyclone criteria, the short-lived depression was declared a remnant low at 21:00 UTC that day.[98]
Tropical Storm Jova
The NHC began monitoring a strong tropical wave over the eastern Caribbean on August 3.[99] The feature pushed westward, developing into Hurricane Franklin before making landfall on the Yucatán,[100] and attaining its peak as a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall near Vega de Alatorre, Veracruz on August 10.[101] Although its low-level circulation dissipated, the NHC in days prior noted the potential for Franklin's mid-level remnants to reform in the East Pacific.[102] The remnants of Franklin induced a surface low off the coast of southwestern Mexico on August 11, and steady organization led to the formation of Tropical Storm Jova by 03:00 UTC the next day.[103] On a westward course, Jova was plagued by strong wind shear from an area of high pressure over northwestern Mexico, with a very disorganized appearance on satellite.[104] After lacking sufficient organization to be declared a tropical cyclone, the storm was declared a remnant low around 03:00 UTC on August 14.[105]
Hurricane Kenneth
On August 12, the NHC noted the potential for an area of low pressure to form well south of Baja California Peninsula during the following days.[106] A large area of disturbed weather developed two days later as predicted;[107] however, organization was slow to occur, and a tropical depression only formed four days later, around 15:00 UTC on August 18.[108] The newly formed cyclone embarked on a west to west-northwest course, intensifying into Tropical Storm Kenneth early on August 19 and further into a hurricane by 15:00 UTC on August 20.[109] Despite forecasts of only slight additional intensification,[110] Kenneth rapidly intensified, with the eye feature warming dramatically and the surrounding cloud tops cooling. The cyclone attained major hurricane strength around 03:00 UTC on August 21,[111] and six hours later reached its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h).[112] Progressively cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused Kenneth to steadily weaken following the intensification trend, with its inner core eroding and low-level circulation becoming displaced.[113] By 21:00 UTC on August 22, the storm weakened below hurricane strength.[114] The following day, at 21:00 UTC, Kenneth was declared post-tropical.
Tropical Storm Lidia
On August 29, the NHC monitored a potential area of Tropical Cyclone development near the coast of Baja California with Tropical Storm Watches and Hurricane Watches stretching from Todos Santos to Los Barriles.[115] The NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Lidia at 00:00 UTC on August 31 about 180 mi (290 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Favorable conditions allowed Lidia to intensify, and by 21:00 UTC on August 31, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 987 mbar (29.1 inHg). Around 12:00 UTC on the following day, Lidia made landfall near Puerto Chale, Baja California Sur, at the same intensity. The cyclone weakened significantly while traversing the mountainous terrain of the Baja California Peninsula, and by early on September 2, deep convection was mainly limited to a few strong clusters near the center. Around that time, Lidia briefly moved offshore, before making another landfall near Punta Abreojos a few hours later. By that time, Lidia had weakened steadily, and emerged over the Pacific Ocean on September 2. However, Lidia continued to weaken due to cold sea surface temperatures. After failing to produce deep convection for about 12–15 hours, the NHC declared that Lidia had degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area at 09:00 UTC on September 2 about 40 mi (65 km/h) southwest of Punta Baja, Baja California.[citation needed]
Hurricane Otis
On September 8, Hurricane Katia of the Atlantic made landfall on Mexico, dissipating on September 9. However, its mid-level circulation survived, and eventually spawned an area of low pressure off the coast of Mexico. On September 11, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E. During the next several days, the depression slowly drifted westward, before strengthening into Tropical Storm Otis on September 16. While only marginal strengthening was forecast, Otis unexpectedly rapidly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane by 17:00 UTC on September 17, despite lower ocean temperatures, drier air, and increased wind shear.[116] Otis continued to intensify into a Category 3 major hurricane by 03:00 UTC on September 18, developing a well-defined eye with a diameter of 10 nautical miles (12 mi; 19 km).[117] By 21:00 UTC on September 18, Otis had rapidly degenerated back into a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 40 knots (46 mph; 74 km/h).[118] Twelve hours after developing a well-defined eye, Otis started weakening at a remarkable rate, losing most of its deep convection from low ocean surface temperatures until it became a remnant low on September 19, due to a lack of convection.[119][120]
Hurricane Max
On September 9, the NHC mentioned the possibility for an area of low pressure to form south of Mexico over later days.[121] A trough of low pressure materialized the next day,[122] steadily organizing into a tropical depression near the southwestern coast of Mexico around 15:00 UTC on September 13. Despite forecasts of little or no intensification,[123] the newly formed cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Max six hours later.[124] Quick intensification ensued as the storm improved in structure and developed a well-defined eye, prompting the NHC to upgrade Max to a hurricane around 12:00 UTC on September 14.[125] After attaining peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h),[126] the hurricane moved ashore the coastline of Guerrero at a slightly reduced strength around 21:00 UTC.[127] The mountainous terrain of inland Mexico severely disrupted Max's circulation, causing it to degenerate by 09:00 UTC on September 15.[128]
In preparation for Max, about 788 people evacuated to temporary shelters.[129] Throughout Guerrero, over 1,500 homes were inundated by floodwaters or damaged by strong winds that ripped off roofs. Over 100 trees were downed, mudslides and sinkholes closed several roads (including Mexican Federal Highway 200), and telephone service was cut. At the height of the storm, 126,503 Comisión Federal de Electricidad customers lost electricity. A bridge between Cruz Grande and Copala was severely damaged, and access to Juchitán de Zaragoza was severed due to a flooded highway. One of 17 rapidly-rising rivers swept away a residence and two neighbors who attempted to rescue the homeowner; one of the neighbors died, constituting one of two deaths attributed to the storm. At least 3,000 residents across five municipalities in Guerrero were stranded.[129][130] Waves of 10–16 ft (3–5 m) battered the coastline, where six ships were sunk.[131]
Hurricane Norma
On September 10, the NHC started to monitor an area of low pressure well south of Manzanillo, Mexico.[132] The disturbance gradually organized during the following days and by 09:00 UTC on September 14 the system was noted to develop a well-defined center and spiral banding.[133] This led to the formation of Tropical Storm Norma, skipping tropical depression status.[134] The newly formed tropical storm continued to intensify at a steady pace while it moved slowly northward, becoming a category 1 hurricane by 03:00 UTC on September 16 and reaching winds of 75 mph (120 km/h).[135] At this time warnings were being required for the southern portions of the Baja California Peninsula as Norma was forecast to become a major hurricane and make landfall in the area.[136] However, its broad circulation and the entrainment of dry air quickly became an impediment in doing so.[137] Norma then weakened back to a tropical storm at 21:00 UTC later that day while becoming stationary, though a developing ridge over Mexico began to move the storm slowly towards the north.[138] Norma maintained its intensity the next day and continued being slowly steered by the ridge towards a northwesterly to west-northwesterly path, all tropical storm warnings were discontinued as Norma started to shift its track more to the west.[139] The cyclone continued weakening for several days as it slowly drifted to the west, until finally being declared a remnant low at 03:00 UTC on September 20.[140]
Tropical Storm Pilar
During the week of September 18, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave,[141] as it spawned a broad area of low pressure located offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico.[142] The disturbance lacked any significant organization until September 23 at around 21:00 UTC when the system was noted to developed surface winds of over 35 mph (55 km/h) becoming Tropical Depression Eighteen-E.[143] The depression organized into a tropical storm six hours later and was given the name Pilar, the sixteenth named storm of the annual Pacific hurricane season.[144] Thereafter, despite having a disorganized appearance on satellite, Pilar's winds increased in strength, and it reached its peak with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h).[145] By 09:00 UTC on September 24, Pilar continued to track north along the coast, with warnings being issued for the southwestern coast of Mexico.[146] However, early on September 25, these warnings were discontinued,[147] as Tropical Storm Pilar showed signs of weakening mainly due to land interaction, and was reduced to a tropical depression before ultimately dissipating at around 21:00 UTC later that same day.[148] Although Pilar did not make landfall as a tropical cyclone, heavy rainfall was reported in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, northeast of Islas Marías and in other areas along the Mexican coastline.[149]
Tropical Storm Ramon
On October 3, the NHC noted a high chance of tropical development in an area of low pressure, to the south of Mexico.[150] The system increased in intensity and became Tropical Storm Ramon early on October 4, skipping tropical depression status.[151] Due to wind shear from a large anticyclone to its north, the storm did not intensify much further.[152] Although it was forecast to linger over open waters as it moved westward, this did not occur and the system quickly grew disorganized.[153] Ramon weakened into a tropical depression later on the same day, having lasted as a tropical storm only for 18 hours.[154] As it moved westward, Ramon continued to weaken, until it finally degenerated into a trough of low pressure on October 5, and the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the degenerated system at 09:00 UTC, on the same day.[155]
Tropical Storm Selma
Storm names
The following names will be used for named storms that form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean during 2017. Retired names, if any, will be announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2018. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2023 season.[156] This same list was used in the 2011 season.
For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists.[157] The next four names slated for use are shown below.
The usage of the Atlantic storm name "Don", and the name "Hilary", in July garnered some negative attention relating to United States President Donald Trump, and former Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. People also took to Twitter to poke fun at the names and both individuals, with political jokes.[158]
Season effects
This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2017 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2017 USD.
