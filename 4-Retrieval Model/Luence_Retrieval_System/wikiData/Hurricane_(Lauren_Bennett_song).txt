Background[edit]
Bennett's second solo single "Hurricane" was released on 2 May 2016 via Interscope Records.[1]
In an Instagram post on 8 May 2016, Bennett explained her inspiration for the single, saying "After G.R.L. ended I had no idea what was going to happen next, everything fell apart pretty fast. That's when this song was written. After seeing my mother suffer with mental struggles for years I then lost a friend to this. It has always effected my life in someway. We all at least know someone who has dealt with it or have yourself. This is a story to show from my eyes what it feels like to suffer from this but also the other perspective to lose someone to this."[2] It was later announced on Twitter that a portion of the proceeds from the single would be donated to The Campaign to Change Direction,[3] an organization dedicated to change the culture of mental health in America.[4]
