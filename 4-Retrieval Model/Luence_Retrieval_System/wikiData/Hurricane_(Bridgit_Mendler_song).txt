Composition[edit]
A midtempo pop song, "Hurricane" exhibits elements of reggae fusion and R&B. Built on a beat and multi-tracked harmonies, the song's instrumentation includes slow-bouncing keyboard tones, and drums. The song was written by Mendler and American songwriters Emanuel Kiriakou, Evan Kidd Bogart, and Andrew Goldstein, and produced by Kiriakou and Goldstein. Lyrically, the song gives ode to a disaster love, and reconciliation and perseverance in love. Mendler's vocals span from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5.[5] In interview for Coup de Main Magazine, Mendler commented about recording a rap song for the first time. She said:
Critical reception[edit]
The song has received positive critical acclaim from music critics. Tim Sendra of AllMusic said, "[Hurricane] has clever fairy tale lyrics and an impassioned vocal (and a sassy rap section)."[7] Girls' Life magazine stated "[Mendler] brings the beat in 'Hurricane', where she belts out some sweet raps about being in the middle of a stormy relationship."[8] Kai of Embrace You magazine claimed that the track title was "quite ironic when we’re currently experiencing one of mother nature’s conception of the said thing" and later said that "interestingly enough, I love this song. The acoustic opener caught me instantly and I’m addicted to her 'oh, oh, oh…' The singer’s play on natural disasters as metaphors for the way she feels about her love interest once again showcases how witty she is as an artist. The fast paced pop rock driven track is both catchy and substantial."[9]
