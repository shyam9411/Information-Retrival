List of retired Australian cyclone names
Tropical cyclones are non-frontal, low pressure systems that develop, within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and little vertical wind shear aloft.[1] Within the Australian region, names are assigned from three pre-determined lists, to such systems, once they reach or exceed ten–minute sustained wind speeds of 65 km/h (40 mph), near the center, by either the Bureau of Meteorology or by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in Jakarta, Indonesia and Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.[1] Within the Australian region, tropical cyclones have been officially named since the 1963–64 Australian region cyclone season, though several meteorological papers show that a few tropical cyclones were named before 1964–65.[2][3][4] The names of significant tropical cyclones that cause a high amount of damage and/or loss of life are retired from the lists of tropical cyclone names by either the Bureau of Meteorology or the World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee at their bi-annual meeting. Storms named by Port Moresby are automatically retired regardless of their impact due to their infrequent occurrence.[1]
Within the Australian region, there have been a total of 113 tropical cyclone names retired, with the 1990s accounting for 44 of these. Two of the most intense systems ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, Cyclones Gwenda and Inigo each attaining a barometric pressure of 900 hPa (26.58 inHg), are among the retired storms. The deadliest cyclone to take place since the 1960s was Cyclone Guba in 2007 which killed 149 people in Papua New Guinea. Additionally, the most damaging system was Severe Tropical Cyclone Tracy in 1974 which devastated the city of Darwin, leaving A$837 million (A$5.65 billion 2011 AUD; US$2.64 billion 2011 USD) in losses.


Background[edit]
Within the region the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems, is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 - 1907.[5] Wragge used names drawn from the letters of the Greek alphabet, Greek and Roman mythology and female names, to describe weather systems including tropical cyclones over Australia, New Zealand and the Antarctic.[5] After the new Australian government had failed to create a federal weather bureau and appoint him director, Wragge started naming cyclones after political figures.[6] This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, before the Australian Bureau of Meteorology started to use female names for tropical cyclones in the region during the 1963-64 cyclone season.[5]
During the International Women's Year of 1975 the Australian Science Minister ordered that tropical cyclones, within the Australian region should carry both men's and women's names.[5] This was because the minister thought "that both sexes should bear the odium of the devastation caused by cyclones."[5] As a result, male names were added to the lists of names for both basins, ahead of the 1975-76 season.[5][7]
The practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the United States Weather Bureau in the Northern Atlantic basin, after hurricanes Carol, Edna, and Hazel struck the Northeastern United States and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year.[8] Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference, that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired.[8][9] Several names have been removed from the Pacific naming lists for various other reasons than causing a significant amount of death/destruction, which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and political reasons.[10][11]
Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 1960s[edit]
There were 3 tropical cyclone names retired during the 1960s, after the naming of tropical cyclones had restarted during the 1963-64 tropical cyclone season.[12][13]
Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 1970s[edit]
During the 1970s, 18 tropical cyclones had their names retired.[20][citation needed] During this period, one of the most well-known storms in Australian history, Cyclone Tracy, took place. It was both the costliest and deadliest of the decade; it would remain the costliest Australian cyclone until 2011 when Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi surpassed it. A total of 87 people were killed between these storms and A$977 million was wrought in damage.
Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 1980s[edit]
Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 1990s[edit]
Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 2000s[edit]
During the 2000s, 23 tropical cyclone names were retired. At the start of the 2008-09 season two sets of Indonesian names were established for the newly established TCWC Jakarta, while the naming lists for the three Australian TCWC's were combined. The name Hamish subsequently became the first name to be retired from these lists, after it impacted the coast of Queensland during 2008-09. The name Laurence was retired after it intensified into a category 5 severe tropical cyclone twice during December 2009 and affected Western Australia.[89]
Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 2010s[edit]
During the 2010s, ten names have been retired, because of impacts caused to either Australia or various South Pacific island nations including the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia and Tonga. At the start of the decade the name Magda was retired, after it made landfall on the Kimberley region of Western Australia, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone.[100] The name Carlos was subsequently retired after it broke several rainfall records, as it impacted Darwin and North-Western Australia during February 2011.[101] The names Heidi and Lua were retired after the 2011-12 season and both had impacted the Pilbara region of Western Australia.[102][103] The name Jasmine was also retired after the 2011-12 season and had affected the island nations of Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Tonga.[104]
