Career[edit]
After both members graduated from Vassar College in 2010, MS MR released a four-song digital demo EP, Ghost City USA (2011), followed by two 2012 singles, "Hurricane" and "Fantasy". The music video for their debut single, "Hurricane", was released on April 26, 2012, with the single released on iTunes on July 10, 2012. It earned positive reviews for its "vintage" sound.[4] The single charted at number 38 in Germany.[5]
"Hurricane" was included on their debut EP, Candy Bar Creep Show, alongside the songs "Bones", "Dark Doo Wop" and "Ash Tree Lane". The EP was released on September 14, 2012.[6]
The music video for their second single, "Fantasy", was released on February 4, 2013. The song was later released on iTunes on March 8, 2013 and became a single of the week.
Their debut album, Secondhand Rapture, was released on May 10, 2013, and included all four songs from the prior EP.
On July 17, 2015 they released their second album, How Does It Feel. After touring for much of 2016, the band announced a hiatus in January 2017 while Plapinger focused on her solo project, LPX.[7]
MS MR's sound has been compared to Florence and the Machine,[8] Lana Del Rey and Kavinsky.[4] Despite growing up in London, Plapinger has no trace of an English accent; her parents are American and she attended an international school.[9]
