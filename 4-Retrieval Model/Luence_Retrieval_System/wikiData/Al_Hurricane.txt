Al Hurricane
Alberto Nelson Sanchez (July 10, 1936 – October 22, 2017), known professionally as Al Hurricane, was an American singer-songwriter, dubbed "The Godfather" of New Mexico music.[2][3] He released more than thirty albums, and is best known for his contributions to New Mexico’s unique style of Spanish music.[4]
He received his nickname, Hurricane, from his mother. As a child, he would accidentally knock things over;[5] the nickname became synonymous with his band, studio, and a recording label.[6] His signature look, which included an eye-patch, was due to an automobile accident that occurred during the 1960s.[7] These things, as well as his performance style, led to Hurricane being known for his ability to improvise and adapt.[8] They have also led to his music and image being ultimately entangled with the history of New Mexico music.[9]
Al Hurricane was often accompanied on stage by his children, sons Al Hurricane, Jr. and Jerry Dean, and daughter Erika. He also performed frequently with his brothers Baby Gaby and Tiny Morrie. He was the subject of a tribute concert which was recorded as a set of two tribute albums, as well a DVD. He has also performed alongside Fats Domino, Marvin Gaye, Chuck Berry, Jimmy Clanton, and Chubby Checker.[10]

Al Hurricane was born on July 10, 1936[4][11] as Alberto Nelson Sanchez the first of four children to Jose Margarito Sanchez (April 28, 1910, Ojo Sarco, New Mexico – September 10, 1979, Albuquerque, New Mexico[12]) and Bennie L. Sanchez (November 26, 1918, Albuquerque, New Mexico – January 27, 2011, Albuquerque, New Mexico[13][14]) in Dixon, New Mexico.
The Sanchez family moved to Silver City and the father worked in the mines, until he became injured. At which point Bennie returned to work as a clerk at a department store in a Silver City. Jose had a band, called Los Sanchez, Bennie would often join in on vocals and guitar. She eventually became a licensed practical nurse while traveling with physicians throughout Northern New Mexico. His father and mother were extremely supportive of their children. Jose, Al's father, was a miner during most of his childhood; but he still found the time to teach the five-year-old Alberto how to play the guitar. Al's mother, Bennie, made quite a name for herself, she became the president of Hurricane Enterprises. She not only promoted her musically-inclined family, but also promoted concerts for Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Chubby Checker, Fats Domino, Little Richard and, the one she was particularly proud of, a 1972 Elvis Presley concert in Albuquerque.[15][16] Her own musically talented family didn't just consist of her sons Al Hurricane, Baby Gaby and Tiny Morrie; it also consisted of Al Hurricane's sons Al Hurricane, Jr. and Jerry Dean; as well as Tiny Morrie's children Lorenzo Antonio and the members of Sparx.[9]
During his childhood he moved to Albuquerque, where he began to play and perform in Old Town at the age of 12.[17] He attended Old Albuquerque High, which he graduated from in 1954.
Al Hurricane & the Night Rockers (1950s–1960s)[edit]
Al became a singing waiter at the La Casita Restaurant in Old Town and, while he wasn't working, he played for tips in and around Old Town Plaza. He also began to sing and write country and rock n' roll music. During this time Al would also perform at the Sky Line Club. It was at this club, and several others, around Albuquerque and New Mexico that he built his audience. One of Al Hurricane's first single records was distributed by Warner Bros. Records it contains two tracks, titled "Lobo" & "Racer". They are both instrumental rock songs and were released in 1962 under the band name Al Hurricane & the Night Rockers with writing credits to "Albert Sanchez – Morrie Sanchez".[18] Other single recordings by Al Hurricane from this time, recorded at Norman Petty's studio include, "South Bend / Burrito" (1960 Apt Records instrumental), "Panchita / La Mula Bronca" (Challenge Records, first tracks with vocals), "Mexican Cat / Pedro’s Girlfriend" (Hurricane Records instrumental), and "Rosita’s Café / Only A Game (Tiny Morrie)" (Hurricane Records).[19][20]

A few years later, in 1967, he released his first album, titled Mi Saxophone. The two lead singles off that album were "Sentimiento" and its eponymous song "Mi Saxophone". "Sentimiento" had already been released in 1965 as a single. These early recordings were recorded on equipment purchased from Norman Petty, that Buddy Holly recorded on. This recording equipment gave the recordings their signature 50s sound.[21]
He began to perform outside the New Mexico music scene, performing in throughout the American Southwest and Western United States in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming; he even toured Northern Mexico in Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Mexico City, Nuevo León, Sonora, and Tamaulipas.[9] In fact, it was on his way to a concert in Denver, Colorado. on November 1, 1969, where he got into a car accident in which he lost his right-eye.[22] This did not deter him from pursuing his musical career, instead it gave him his unique performing look, an eye-patch across his right eye. He even went on to play other American cities in other regions such as Chicago and Miami; Al Hurricane has even played internationally in the cities of Asunción, Buenos Aires, and Málaga.[21]

After the New Mexico State Penitentiary riot, in 1980, Al Hurricane wrote a song that was "strictly narrative, not a subjective account or soapbox. The song does not attempt to assign blame."[31] The song was called "(El Corrido De) La Prison De Santa Fe" it is the lead song on an album titled, La Prision de Santa Fe.
A few of Bennie Sanchez's kids, Al Hurricane, Tiny Morrie, and Baby Gaby, got together to do a tribute album for her.
