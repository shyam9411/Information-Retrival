Jeep Hurricane
The Jeep Hurricane is a bespoke custom concept vehicle that was unveiled at the 2005 North American International Auto Show in Detroit by American off-road brand Jeep. The Hurricane's one-piece body is composed largely of light-weight structural carbon fiber.[1] Its skid plate is an aluminum spine that connects the chassis to the underside of the vehicle. The Hurricane doesn’t have side doors or a roof, and there is only seating for two people. The driver and passenger enter the vehicle over bulkheads on each side. The Hurricane features a Chrysler designed and patented four-wheel steering system, which was outsourced to MillenWorks that allows the Hurricane to move sideways.[2][3] Its principal exterior designer was Aaron Pizzuti.[4] The concept went on to win IDEA Silver Award,[5] a Popular Science "Best of what's new" award,[6] and an AutoWeek Editor's Choice award in the "Most Fun" category.[7]


Future Development[edit]
It is not expected to be a production vehicle due to the complexity and cost of the drivetrain, however many patents were secured in the Hurricane’s development.
