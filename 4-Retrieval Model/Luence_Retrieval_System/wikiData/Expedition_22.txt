Expedition 22
Expedition 22 was the 22nd long duration crew flight to the International Space Station (ISS). This expedition began in November 2009 when the Expedition 21 crew departed. For a period of 3 weeks, there were only 2 crew members; it was the first time that had happened since STS-114. Commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Maksim Surayev were joined by the rest of their crew on 22 December 2009, making the Expedition 22 a crew of five.[1]
The expedition ended when Soyuz TMA-16 undocked on 17 March 2010, and was immediately followed by the start of Expedition 23.
