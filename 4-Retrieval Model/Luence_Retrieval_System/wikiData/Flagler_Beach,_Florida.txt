Flagler Beach Historical Museum[edit]
The Flagler Beach Historical Museum's permanent collection is entirely dedicated to Florida history, featuring Flagler Beach and Flagler County. The collection ranges from prehistoric bones and other remains of the Stone Age to a "Space Age" side. The latter has an exhibit with items provided by NASA astronauts, including space food and the Flagler Beach city flag, which was sent to orbit the earth aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour.
Orange Period pottery pieces from indigenous peoples of the region date from 2000 B.C. to 500 A.D. Historic Native American Indian life is represented by an exhibit of arrowheads and other artifacts, all discovered in Flagler County.
The Florida territory had changing European rulers in the war years between the 1500s and the early 1800s: Spanish, English and American. Mill and plantation artifacts make up the display about the Plantation Period. Personal use items, such as buttons and bottles obtained from area missions, represent the history of individuals in the area. From the Mala Compra Plantation, burned down during the Second Seminole War, the Museum has items from the early 19th-century home of Joseph Hernandez, who was elected as the first Hispanic congressman in the U.S.
The period of the late 1800s and early 1900s are represented by books and exhibits about the area's economy: county farming of cabbage and potatoes, timber industry, railroad artifacts, and turpentine camp items. Exhibits also include documents and memorabilia associated with the 20th-century development boom that began in the western portion of Flagler County and was continued oceanside. Displays feature four Flagler Beach "first families" who purchased land and built what was once considered a seaside resort.
Other display items from the early 1900s include memorabilia from early city government, the county's Old Brick Road, the Flagler Beach Hotel, World War II items, the A1A highway, Marineland, and early advertising brochures. Representations of local organizations from 1925 forward are represented in displays featuring the Flagler Beach Fire Department, Boy Scouts of Flagler, and Flagler Beach schools.
Fire department[edit]
The Flagler Beach Fire Department was established in 1926 by the Town of Flagler Beach's Commission. Currently, Flagler Beach has a population of roughly 5,500 year-round residents and its fire department responds to approximately 1,000 calls a year. The City of Flagler Beach is served by a full-time professional staff on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide immediate response 365 days a year. In the 21st century, the city has seven full-time employees in the fire department, 1-Fire Chief, 1-Asst. Fire Chief, and 5-Firefighter/EMTs. To complement the career staff, about twenty volunteer firefighters participate in actions.
For firefighting they have two engines (1996 Pierce & 2005 E-One) and an aerial apparatus (1984 Grumman). For wildland or brush fires, they have a woods truck (1967 Military 6x6) and a small brush truck (2003 Chevrolet). As this is a coastal community with water on two sides, the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Intracoastal Waterway to the west, water rescue equipment is essential. The department has two boats (1994 AVON Inflatable & 2006 Patten Inflatable), along with a WaveRunner personal water craft (2005 Yamaha). They have a 4-wheeler ATV (2005 Yamaha) for hauling this equipment. The Fire Chief uses a Command Vehicle for daily operations; a Fire Police unit carries highway safety equipment used to protect firefighters and victims at traffic accidents.[14]
