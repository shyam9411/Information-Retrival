ACA Hurricane
The ACA Hurricane was a 130dB civilian defense siren, created in 1968, and stopped production around 1980, produced by Alerting Communicators of America, now American Signal Corporation. The Hurricane is very similar to the Federal Signal Thunderbolt Series.


History[edit]
The ACA Hurricane 130 was designed by Alerting Communicators of America and presented at a Civil Defense convention in November, 1968. They introduced other sirens, however, this utilized new fiber casting techniques, never before used by any other company. The Hurricane started off with a square horn (very similar to the Federal Signal Thunderbolt), but ended with two throats where the horn attaches to the chopper enclosure. These were produced until 1973, when a larger, rounded horn was made that was a true exponential horn. The siren was popular with towns looking for a high output 130dB siren. The corporation continued production until 1980, when it was replaced with the P-50 50 HP, 135Â dB siren (also known as the T-135). All Hurricanes are very rare, as most of them have been replaced by newer sirens. Additionally, the Hurricane siren was a supercharged mechanical siren, utilizing a blower and high output chopper similar to the Federal Signal Thunderbolt.
