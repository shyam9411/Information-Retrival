During the 21 years that South Carolina had legalized video poker, Little River's location near the North Carolina state line made the community a major center for the activity. In 1996, local churches began protesting legalized gambling in what had become Little Reno, and the state outlawed the games in 2000. Two years before the video poker ban, casino boats began operating and continue to do so in federal waters because the state has not specifically banned them. Little River has the state's only two casino boats, the SunCruz Aquasino and The Big M Casino.[4]
Little River was the first known community in Horry County and was first settled by the Lewis's and Waitie, Vereen and Tilighman families.[citation needed] It was known as a trade goods port and fishing community, and was a regular haunt of pirates seeking refuge in its salt water marshes and estuaries off the ocean. First President George Washington visited Little River and spent the night with Jeremiah Vereen in his cabin near the South Carolina/North Carolina state line.
