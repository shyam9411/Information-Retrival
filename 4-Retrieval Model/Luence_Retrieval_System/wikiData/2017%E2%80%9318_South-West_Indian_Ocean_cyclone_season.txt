2017–18 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season
The 2017–18 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season is a current event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone and subtropical cyclone formation. It officially began on November 1, 2017, and will end officially on April 30, 2018, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, for which it will end on May 15, 2018. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90°E and south of the Equator. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion.


Seasonal summary[edit]
Systems[edit]
Other systems[edit]
A low-pressure system, classified as a tropical low by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology,[1] moved west-southwest across the 90th meridian east into the Southwest Indian Ocean basin on August 8.[2] At 10:00 UTC the following day, Météo-France Réunion upgraded the low-pressure system to a zone of disturbed weather, with sustained winds of up to 55 km/h (35 mph) being detected on the southern side of the circulation by scatterometer.[3] At this time, the disturbance was located approximately 2,375 km (1,475 mi) west of Jakarta, Indonesia.[3] Météo-France noted that the revival of convective activity in the basin was likely due to the interaction between an eastwards-moving Kelvin wave and a westwards-moving Rossby wave.[3]
Storm names[edit]
Within the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical depressions and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 65 km/h (40 mph) by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on La Réunion Island, France (RSMC La Réunion) are usually assigned a name. However, it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E. If instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30°E and 55°E then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. Beginning from the 2016–17 season, name lists within the South-West Indian Ocean will be rotated on a triennial basis. Storm names are only used once, so any storm name used this year will be removed from rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2020–21 season. The unused names are expected to be reused in the list for the 2020–21 season.[4]
Seasonal effects[edit]
This table lists all of the tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones that were monitored during the 2017–2018 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. Information on their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, primarily comes from RSMC La Réunion. Death and damage reports come from either press reports or the relevant national disaster management agency while the damage totals are given in 2017 or 2018 USD.
