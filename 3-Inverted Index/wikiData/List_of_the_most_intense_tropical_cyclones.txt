List of the most intense tropical cyclones
Tropical cyclone intensity is a complex topic. Winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas, and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds. However variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult. In addition, other impacts like rainfall, storm surge, area of wind damages, and tornadoes can be significant variations in storms with similar wind speeds. Pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because measurements is easier to measure and consistent. Tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on Earth. However, although there is strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds, storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds, as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different.[1]
In the most recent and reliable records, most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900 hPa (mbar) (26.56 inHg) or less occurred in the Western North Pacific Ocean. The strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide, as measured by minimum central pressure, was Typhoon Tip, which reached a pressure of 870 hPa (25.69 inHg) on October 12, 1979.[2] The following list is subdivided by basins. Data listed are provided by the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre, unless otherwise noted. On October 23, 2015, Hurricane Patricia attained the strongest 1-minute sustained winds on record at 215 mph (345 km/h).[3]


North Atlantic Ocean[edit]
The most intense storm in the North Atlantic by lowest pressure was Hurricane Wilma. The strongest storm by 1-minute sustained winds was Hurricane Allen.
Storms which reached a minimum central pressure of 920 hectopascals (27.17 inHg) or less are listed. Storm information has been compiled back to 1850, though measurements were rarer until aircraft reconnaissance started in the 1940s, and inexact estimates were still predominant until dropsondes were implemented in the 1970s. [4]
Eastern Pacific Ocean[edit]
The most intense storm in the Eastern Pacific Ocean by both sustained winds and central pressure was Hurricane Patricia. Its sustained winds of 345 km/h (215 mph) are also the highest on record globally.
Storms with a minimum central pressure of 925 hPa (27.32 inHg) or less are listed. Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1949, and most storms since are only estimated because landfall (and related reconnaissance) are less common in this basin.[6]
Western North Pacific Ocean[edit]
The most intense storm by lowest pressure and peak 10-minute sustained winds was Typhoon Tip, which was also the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded.
Storms with a minimum pressure below 900 hPa (26.58 inHg) are listed. Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1950.[6]
North Indian Ocean[edit]
The strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the North Indian Ocean is the 1999 Odisha Cyclone, with 3-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a minimum pressure of 912 hPa (26.93 inHg).
Storms with an intensity of 950 hPa (28.05 inHg) or less are listed. Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1971.[6]
South-West Indian Ocean[edit]
The most intense tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean is Cyclone Gafilo. By 10-minute sustained wind speed, the strongest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean is Cyclone Fantala.
Storms with an intensity of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) or less are listed. Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985.[6]
Australian Region[edit]
The most intense tropical cyclones in the Australian Region are Cyclone Gwenda and Cyclone Inigo. By 10-minute sustained wind speed, the strongest are Cyclone Orson and Cyclone Monica.
Storms with an intensity of 922 hPa (27.23 inHg) or less are listed. Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985.[6]
South Pacific Ocean[edit]
A total of 16 cyclones are listed down below reaching/surpassing that intensity, which most of them occurred during El Niño seasons. Tropical cyclones that have been recorded since the start of the 1969–70 Tropical Cyclone year and have reached their peak intensity to the west of 160E are included in the list. The most intense tropical cyclone in the south Pacific, Cyclone Winston of 2016, is also the most intense storm in the Southern Hemisphere.
Storms with an intensity of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) or less are listed. Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985.[6]
South Atlantic Ocean[edit]
Until recently, it was not known that tropical cyclones could exist in the southern Atlantic. However, Hurricane Catarina in 2004, to date the only hurricane in the south Atlantic, brought additional review. A subsequent study found that there was an average of 1-2 subtropical or tropical cyclones per year in the Southern Atlantic in recent decades.[26] No official database of South Atlantic cyclones exists, but a partial list of tropical and subtropical systems with intensity below 1000 hPa (29.53 inHg) is listed.
