Hurricanes (TV series)
Hurricanes is an animated series produced by DIC Entertainment, Siriol Productions and Scottish Television.[1] The show was distributed by Bohbot Entertainment for syndication outside of the UK, with Scottish Television controlling the UK rights. The series first aired in 1993 and ended in 1997.


Summary[edit]
The series focused on a fictional football team headed by the female inheritor of the teams' legacy, Amanda Carey and their coach, Jock Stone. Stone was notably based on Celtic F.C. manager Jock Stein. During the series, the Hurricanes football team would either be battling a renegade football club, The Gorgons managed by Stavros Garkos, for pitch supremacy or having wild, unpredictable adventures off the field in exotic world touring locations.
Despite such a lengthy episode number, and a cult following among British football fans who watched it faithfully in reruns during the football seasons, the Hurricanes remained a fairly dormant and minor addition to BKN's library, and its impact worldwide is barely minimum, its most memorable aspect being its theme song ("We're the Hurricanes").
The programme had been aired in weekly first-run syndication in the United States in the late 1990s, though it did not see mainstream broadcasting until the fall of 2012 when Cookie Jar Entertainment (whom DIC had merged with), which had re-acquired the rights to the show from BKN through a bankruptcy in 2010, added the program to the weekday Cookie Jar-controlled This Is for Kids lineup on the This TV digital subchannel network.
In 2015, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh began re-airing the show daily and also added the programme to the STV Player.[2]
