Agatha Christie (band)
Agatha Christie (Russian: Агата Кристи) was a Soviet and Russian rock band, one of the most popular in the country in the middle and in the second half of the 1990s. Founded in 1988 in Sverdlovsk.[1]
Officially, however, the history of the group is counted from the concert February 20, 1988.[1]
After the collapse of Agatha Christie in 2010, the former lead singer Gleb Samoylov, together with keyboardist Konstantin Bekrev and drummer Dmitry Khakimov created the group The Matrixx.
Vladislav Surkov, an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was credited with penning some of the lyrics for Agatha Christie's songs.[2]
