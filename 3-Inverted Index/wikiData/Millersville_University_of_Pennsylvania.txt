Millersville University of Pennsylvania
Millersville University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Millersville University, The Ville,or MU) is an American public university located in Millersville, Pennsylvania, United States, offering programs embracing the liberal arts as one of the fourteen schools that comprise the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE). Founded in 1855 as the first Normal School in Pennsylvania, Millersville is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools[2] and the Pennsylvania Department of Education.[3]
First established in 1854 as the Millersville Academy out of the since demolished Old Main,[4] the Academy specialized in a series of workshop-style teacher institutes in response to the 1934 Free School Act of Pennsylvania.[5]


History[edit]
Millersville University was established in 1855 as the Lancaster County Normal School, the first state normal school in Pennsylvania. It subsequently changed its name to the Millersville State Normal School in 1859 and Millersville later became a state teachers college in 1927. It was renamed Millersville State College in 1959 and officially became Millersville University of Pennsylvania in 1983.
In November 1852, the Lancaster County Educational Association met in Strasburg resolving to form an institute for teacher training. The first institute, which led to the Lancaster County Normal School and received major support from Thomas H. Burrowes, was held in January 1853. While the Association was working to organize, Lewis M. Hobbs, a popular teacher of the Manor district, lobbied heavily in Manor township for a more permanent training facility for teachers. Jacob Shenk, a local farmer, donated a tract of five acres (present-day site of Ganser Library, Biemesderfer Executive Center, and Dutcher Hall) with Hobbs collecting investments from local residents. On April 17, 1855, Lancaster County Normal School opened with James P. Wickersham as Principal and a peak of 147 teachers in attendance. President of the school was Thomas H. Burrowes and Vice President was Lewis M. Hobbs. November 5, 1855 marked the start of the first full session, with a new expansion off of the original Academy building that made 96 rooms available for nearly 200 students and their teachers.[6]
Completed in 1894, the Biemesderfer Executive Center, also known as the Old Library, is the centerpiece of Millersville University's campus. The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees designated $27,500 for the construction of the library in 1891 with the contract awarded to Lancastrian D.H. Rapp, who submitted the lowest bid in a blind auction.[7]
The Millersville University Library is housed in Ganser Hall. In September 2011, the University closed Ganser Hall for two years in order to complete renovations.[8] On August 26, 2013, the Ganser Library reopened as the McNairy Library and Learning Forum at Ganser Hall.

Housing[edit]
Student Services, Inc. is in the process of building the final phase of a three phase project comprising eight new residence halls at Millersville University.[8] Once the new halls are complete, the University will maintain Bard and Gilbert Halls as overflow housing with Gaige Hall planned for demolition in the spring of 2016. Other housing options include Shenks Hall, Reighard Hall (formerly the Inn at Millersville), Brookwood Court and Healthy Living apartments.
New facilities[edit]
Lombardo Welcome Center[edit]
On August 29, 2015, local community members Samuel and Dena Lombardo announced a gift to Millersville University of $1.2M for the creation of the University's new Welcome Center and first state-of-the-art Net-Zero energy building on campus. This building, named the Lombardo Welcome Center, will produce as much energy as it consumes and represents the University's largest single-donation to date.[9] On the grounds of former Hull Hall, once complete the Lombardo Welcome Center will house the offices of Admissions, Housing & Residential Life, Marketing and the Office of the Vice President for Enrollment Management.
Francine G. McNairy Library & Learning Forum[edit]
Originally built from 1965-1967 on the grounds of Old Main, the Helen Ganser Library closed its doors in 2011 for an extensive 2-year renovation project and re-opened in 2013 as the Francine G. McNairy Library & Learning Forum. The entire complex is named after Millersville's 13th President, Dr. Francine McNairy, who began her career at Millersville first as Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs before becoming President in 2003.[10] Ganser Hall, named for Helen A. Ganser (1911-1952), librarian and head of the Library Science Department,[11] is the 9-story building that houses the University's academic collection. Serving as the academic heart of campus for over 40 years, Ganser Hall's beginning with the two famous "Bookwalks" of 1967.
During the renovation, Library Services was temporarily relocated to Gerhart Hall (22 East Frederick Street). A network of conveyor belts wound around the 9-story stairwell at the beginning of the project so the general collection could be boxed and shipped for temporary storage. Renovation of the building not only brings the academic heart of campus up to ADA Compliance, but also includes redesigned smart classrooms, natural lighting and a café serving Starbucks.[12] On Monday August 26, 2013 the new library finally opened its doors to the Millersville University community as a new, dynamic home for over 500,000 books, 100,000 periodicals, and dozens of other resources, including a brand new reading room as well as a room with garden views of campus.[13]
Currently, the Library offers a laptop borrowing service for students, has rooms available for reservation, is home to a 24-hour study room[14] and is a part of the EZ-Borrow network, where students, faculty and staff can request a book from another library and arrives in as little as four days to the circulation desk.[15] The Library also hosts several student-worker positions each semester.[16]
