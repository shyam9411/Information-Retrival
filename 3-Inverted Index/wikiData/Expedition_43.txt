Expedition 43
Expedition 43 was the 43rd expedition to the International Space Station. It commenced on 11 March 2015 with the undocking of Soyuz TMA-14M, returning the crew of Expedition 42 to Earth and ended with the departure of Soyuz TMA-15M on 11 June 2015.
The Expedition 43 spend an extra four weeks due to a delay caused by a re-supply spacecraft issue, and the extra time was called a "bonus month" by the crew.[1] On June 8, 2015 ISS adjusted its orbit to allow a bigger distance to a piece of orbital space debris.[2]
This expedition also used the ISSpresso machine and tested a special cup designed to be drunk from in microgravity by using capillary flow.[3] This was a further development of a zero gravity cup invented by Canadian astronaut Donald Pettit and tested on ISS in 2008.[4][5] The new zero g coffee cup idea was further developed by a Fluid physicist at Portland State University among others.[6]
