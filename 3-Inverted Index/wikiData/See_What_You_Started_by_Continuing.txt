See What You Started by Continuing
See What You Started by Continuing is the ninth studio album by American rock band Collective Soul. It was released on October 2, 2015 by Vanguard Records.
The album represents a return to the classic guitar-driven rock sound that the band were known for during the 1990s. Recording began in 2014, with newcomers Johnny Rabb and Jesse Triplett joining longtime members Ed Roland, Dean Roland and Will Turpin in the studio to create the band's first album since 2009. It became the number-one alternative album for the week of October 24, 2015.
Four singles have been released from the album: "This," "AYTA," "Hurricane", and "Contagious." The band promoted the album through the See What You Started Tour.


Background[edit]
On August 25, 2009, Collective Soul released their self-titled eighth studio album, also known as Rabbit to differentiate it from the band's 1995 album of the same name.[1]
Following the release of Rabbit, various members of Collective Soul were involved in side projects.[2]
In an interview with Audio Ink Radio in 2011, Turpin was asked if he foresaw Collective Soul doing a new album at any point: "Yeah, I sure do. Can't really say for sure, but there are definitely discussions going on about scheduling that, and songs have been played and started, so we've already started some creativity. But, nothing is really scheduled yet. I would think that the next six months, we'll get something going on."[9]
In January 2012, drummer Cheney Brannon left Collective Soul to pursue other music opportunities; Johnny Rabb was later named his replacement. The band embarked on the 2012 Dosage Tour from May to July.
The band kicked off their 2014 North American winter tour on January 15 at Belly Up in Aspen, Colorado, where lead guitarist Jesse Triplett made his live debut as a member of Collective Soul. Triplett replaced Joel Kosche, who had been with the band since replacing original lead guitarist Ross Childress in 2001. On February 6, Collective Soul publicly confirmed Kosche's departure from the band: "After 13 great years, Joel Kosche has moved on in the world of music. Collective Soul welcomes Jesse Triplett as our new lead guitarist.[10]
In February 2014, the band announced they would be releasing their ninth studio album, See What You Started by Continuing, during the summer (in the Northern Hemisphere) that year.[11]
Throughout their 2014 touring schedule, Collective Soul road-tested songs later featured on See What You Started by Continuing.[12]
Despite reports that the album would be released in August or September,[13][14] the album was pushed back from its anticipated summer release to the following year. On September 10, Ed Roland responded to questions regarding the album's release: "First of all thanks to all of you for your patience, we are so happy you are eager to hear new tunes! We are diligently working to bring you something worth the wait. I'm finishing vocals this week and then we mix. With a realistic amount of setup time to launch we are looking at early 2015. That's the best estimate I can give you at the moment. Many thanks!"[15]
On December 25, 2014, the band offered a sneak preview of the album by making it available for streaming on SoundCloud exclusively for Christmas Day.[16][17]
Billboard exclusively premiered the album on September 25, 2015, one week ahead of its commercial release.[18]
See What You Started by Continuing, Collective Soul's first album in six years, was released on October 2, 2015 by Vanguard Records.[19]
Recording[edit]
See What You Started by Continuing was recorded between February to October 2014 at Ed Roland's home studio in Sandy Springs, Georgia.[13][20] Roland served as the album's producer.[20] The album was mixed by Shawn Grove and masted by Steve Rawls at Real 2 Reel Studios.[21]
Several songs were written for the album;[22][23] "Comes Back to You," "Lover Boy in the Rain," and "No Idea" were among those left off the album.
Titling[edit]
The album's title was chosen by Ed Roland. "It kinda fits not only the band, but personally what we've been through over the years," Roland told Melissa Ruggieri of Access Atlanta. "Things happen and you keep moving."[13] Roland later told Empty Lighthouse Magazine, "It's like a second wind for us it just felt like the title related to what we're doing which is getting back to doing what we love."[24]

Reception[edit]
Critical reception[edit]
See What You Started by Continuing received positive reviews from critics.

Tony of AnthemStatus.com summarized that the album "falls right back into the comfort of drawn-out ballads, background cooing, and light-hearted rock sure to please the current constituent of fans which is nothing more than simply fine."[57]
