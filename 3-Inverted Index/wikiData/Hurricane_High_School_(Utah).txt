History[edit]
The first school classes were held in Hurricane in 1906 in the living room of Ira E. Bradshaw's home, consisting of grades one through eight. Hurricane's first high school class graduated in the 1927-1928 school year.
A two-story red brick high school building was built during the Great Depression with help from the federal government’s Works Progress Administration. The building was completed and the school opened just after Thanksgiving in 1936.
The school chose the colors red and black because those are the colors on a hurricane warning flag. The school then chose the nickname Tigers because it was an animal that could be rendered easily in black and red.[2]
In 1974, a new gymnasium and three classrooms were completed at the current school site, the first phase of construction of the current facilities. Students walked between the old high school building and the new building for classes. In 1978, classrooms and a cafeteria were added, and grades 9-12 moved to the new building. The old building remained in use for other grades until it was demolished in the spring of 2004. A new auditorium, auxiliary gym, and administrative office areas were added in 1996. In 2001, a science hall was added and named for the outgoing principal, Robert Goulding.
The school's enrollment continues to grow and has forced a new expansion/remodel of the existing building. It was completed in 2011 and students started being enrolled in the new building in 2012. The new building has three stories.
Jody Rich is the current principal at Hurricane High School.
