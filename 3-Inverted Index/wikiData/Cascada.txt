Cascada
Cascada (/kəˈskɑːdə/;[1][2] Spanish for Waterfall) is a German dance music act founded in 2004 by singer Natalie Horler, DJ Manian and DJ Yanou. They are best known for their hit singles "Everytime We Touch", "What Hurts the Most" and "Evacuate the Dancefloor". Cascada have sold over 30 million albums worldwide, an estimated 15 million digital downloads, and have an estimated net worth of over 7 million. Cascada represented Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö, Sweden. While being one of the most successful acts of the dance music genre itself, Cascada were named the most successful German act of the 21st century.[3]


Music career[edit]
2004–05: Early career[edit]
When Natalie Horler was 17, she was doing studio work for various DJs. Eventually she met Yanou and DJ Manian. Originally, they released music under the name Cascade, but due to Kaskade, another artist with a similar name, threatening legal action, they changed it to Cascada.[4] They simultaneously released music under the names of Siria and Akira as well, but ended those projects due to the success of Cascada. Under Andorfine Records, they produced their debut and hit single, "Miracle", and its follow-up, "Bad Boy", in Germany.[5] This caught the attention of the American dance label Robbins Entertainment. They negotiated a contract and "Miracle" was released in 2004. However, it did not attract much attention, so Cascada offered them "Everytime We Touch".
2005–07: Everytime We Touch[edit]
Cascada experienced mainstream success in the United Kingdom and the United States almost a year after releasing their second American single, "Everytime We Touch", which interpolates the chorus of a 1992 Maggie Reilly song of the same name.[6][7] The song gained platinum and gold certifications across the globe, being certified platinum by the RIAA.[8][9] Soon after the popularity of the single skyrocketed, an album was recorded and released in a matter of months,[10] and a music video for "Everytime We Touch" was also distributed for promotion.[11]
A total of eight singles were released from the album, four of which have been released in the United Kingdom: "Everytime We Touch", "Truly Madly Deeply" (originally by Savage Garden),"Miracle" and "A Neverending Dream" (originally by X-Perience), all of which gained top 10 status apart from "A Neverending Dream", which charted at #46.[12] The U.S. saw the re-release of "Miracle" shortly after "Everytime We Touch"'s breakthrough, receiving high radio rotation and reaching the lower ends of the U.S. charts.[13] Their album Everytime We Touch has experienced success in the UK Album chart where it remained up in the top forty for twenty-four weeks, peaking at #2.[14][15] The album experienced success on the U.S. charts as well.[16] The success of the album gained them two World Music Award nominations, winning them World's Best-Selling German Artist.[17] Additionally, the album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide.
2007–09: Perfect Day[edit]
Horler first announced that Cascada were working on their second album during a Japanese interview, which was posted on their blog on MySpace.[18] There are a few cover songs on the album, most notably Avril Lavigne's "Sk8er Boi", P!nk's "Just Like A Pill", Patti Smith's "Because the Night" and the Jeffrey Steele song "What Hurts the Most", as well as two tracks, "Endless Summer" and "I Will Believe It", that were previously recorded by Horler and DJ Manian under the discontinued Siria name.[19] However, the U.S. release replaced the Siria songs,[20] P!nk, and Avril Lavigne covers with three newer tracks, because they did not have the North American rights. Two of these songs were "Faded", a cover of a Kate DeAraugo song, and "Holiday", a cover of a Jenny May song.[21] The second album was released at the end of 2007 in the UK, and several parts of Northern Europe.[22] Perfect Day was released to the remaining markets, in the first quarter of 2008, with the U.S. release being the last.[23] Horler also stated in a French interview, before the release, that she would take a hand in writing parts of the album;[24] however, she did not write any of the final tracks on the album.[25]
The worldwide lead single, "What Hurts the Most", was released in late 2007 and early 2008, along with its B-side, a cover of Wham!'s "Last Christmas".[26] The single had high success, reaching the top ten in most countries.[27] The U.K. and German follow-up to "What Hurts the Most", is "What Do You Want From Me?",[28][29] originally thought to be called "Tell Me Why".[30] The third release from the album in the UK and Germany was "Because the Night".[31][32] The United States instead received both "Faded" and "Perfect Day" as singles, however each of these releases received little airplay outside of the dance-radio circuit.
2009–10: Evacuate the Dancefloor[edit]
On 29 June 2009, "Evacuate the Dancefloor" was released in the UK. The release, just four days after the death of Michael Jackson, was expected to chart within the top ten, underneath a plethora of the deceased King of Pop's former hits, due to a resurgence of sales after the news. To the surprise of many, the single debuted at No. 1, over Jackson's "Man in the Mirror". The song went on to achieve top five success in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as top ten success in many more. The song slowly rose on the U.S. chart after a late September release, eventually reaching a peak of No. 25 after a seventeen-week climb, becoming the group's second top-forty hit. The song has become a club staple, used in many dance-
oriented video games, and even nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. The album, also named Evacuate the Dancefloor, was released a week later on 6 July in the UK and Germany. The album continued Cascada's progression into electro-pop, the change was welcomed by mainstream audiences and fans, yet many fans still remorsed the euro-pop feel, which some felt was integral to the Cascada project. The album itself did not mirror the success of the single, yet it did chart in the top ten of many territories, including the UK. However, the album did not have lasting sales and quickly fell out of the charts. "Dangerous" and "Fever" were follow-up singles released from the album, the former in the UK, and the latter in the US, Australia, and the rest of Europe, neither experiencing success in terms of radio spins, digital, or physical sales. Nevertheless, the group toured extensively to promote the album, even opening for Britney Spears during a stop in Germany.
2010–11: Original Me[edit]
A new single "Pyromania" was released in 2010, continuing their new electropop sound. A second single, "Night Nurse", was released along with a music video featuring Horler in full body paint of various colors in many scenes. This single was never actually released until a year later on 16 December 2011 when it got an exclusive release in the U.S.
On the weekend of 26 March, Cascada shot two music videos for the upcoming singles "San Francisco" and "Au Revoir". Both videos were directed by Lisa Mann and choreographed by Luther Brown, and both singles were featured on the album Original Me which was released on 20 June 2011 (UK),[33] and 29 November 2011 in the US.
After the release of the album, Horler posed for Playboy Deutschland in July 2011,[34] to mixed reactions from fans and critics. On 1 September 2011, US label Robbins Entertainment announced on their message board that Cascada and Robbins have amicably parted ways, and Cascada were released from the label, citing creative differences as the reason for their departure. It was also announced that Original Me would still be released, under their Zooland label.[35][36]
2012–13: The Best of Cascada, Eurovision Song Contest 2013 and Acoustic Sessions[edit]
On 7 January 2012, Horler joined the judging panel of season 9 of German singing contest Deutschland sucht den Superstar.[37] On 16 March 2012, the music video for "Summer of Love" premiered in Germany.[38] and was released on 30 March followed by the compilation album titled Back on the Dancefloor.

On 12 November 2012, Horler announced via Facebook that their long-awaited Christmas Album would be released and would feature her father, David Horler, playing the trombone on two of the tracks.[43] On 30 November 2012, the album It's Christmas Time was released digitally via Zooland Records, and features 11 well known Christmas songs, including a cover of Wham!'s "Last Christmas", as well as the brand new track "Somewhere At Christmas Time" written especially for the album.[44]
On 17 December 2012, the north German regional broadcaster NDR announced that Cascada would take part in the German national final Unser Song für Malmö for a chance to represent Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 with their single "Glorious". Cascada won the German national final which was held on 14 February 2013 in Hannover, and therefore will represent Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. Despite being considered one of the favorites to win the competition (placing the song in 4th place among OGAE voting), on 18 May 2013, Cascada's "Glorious" earned 18 points in the Eurovision Final, putting them in 21st place.
On 8 February 2013, Cascada released the single "Glorious" followed by the release of their second greatest hits album, The Best of Cascada, on 29 March 2013. After the Eurovision Song Contest 2013, Cascada released a second single "The World is in My Hands" on 2 Aug.[45] They also returned to the studio to work on their promised acoustic album which was released as Acoustic Sessions on 1 November 2013.[46] The album features acoustic versions of past hits from the band as well as a few covers of other songs. The most notable cover version was "You" performed by both Natalie and Robin Stjernberg.

Eventually, "Blink" was released in the UK as track on a Clubland compilation. Robbins Entertainment also announced that they would release "Blink" in the United States.[51]
A recent interview with Natalie confirmed that the group currently has no plans to release a 5th studio album just yet, however Natalie did mention that they will be back in the studio very soon to work on the next single.[52]

The video was shot in Mallorca, Spain and premiered on 20 February 2015.[57] On 28 May 2015, it was announced that Natalie would be taking a short break due to her pregnancy.

It was released on 10 June 2016.[62][63][64] A brand new song titled "A.Y.O." was added to the songs repertory on the ASCAP website.[65] "A.Y.O." is noted to be written by Allan Eshuijs, who has worked with Cascada in the past on multiple songs including 'Evacuate', and Daniella Pavicic, an artist and songwriter who shared the same label Robbins Entertainment with Cascada.
