Hurricane (cocktail)
The hurricane is a sweet alcoholic drink made with rum, fruit juice, and syrup or grenadine. It is one of many popular drinks served in New Orleans.
The creation of this passion fruit–colored relative of a daiquiri is credited to New Orleans tavern owner Pat O'Brien.[1] The bar allegedly started as a speakeasy called Mr. O'Brien's Club Tipperary and the password was "storm's brewin'".[1]
In the 1940s, he needed to create a new drink to help him get rid of all of the less-popular rum that local distributors forced him to buy before he could get a few cases of more popular liquors such as scotch and other whiskeys.[2][3] He poured the concoction into hurricane lamp–shaped glasses and gave it away to sailors.
The drink caught on, and it has been a mainstay in the French Quarter ever since. It is more commonly served in a disposable plastic cup, as New Orleans laws permit drinking in public and leaving a bar with a drink, but the city prohibits public drinking from glass containers.[4]
The hurricane cocktail is made differently on the islands of the Bahamas. The drink is composed of various measures of coffee liqueur, 151 rum, Irish cream, and Grand Marnier. It is commonly found in the downtown bars of Nassau.
