List of retired Philippine typhoon names
Since 1963, there have been three agencies who have named tropical cyclones within the north western Pacific Ocean which has often resulted in a cyclone having two names. From 1945 to 2000 the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigned names to tropical cyclones before the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), took over the naming of tropical cyclones in 2000. Both agencies assigned names to tropical cyclones when they intensified into a tropical storm. Since 1963 the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has assigned local names to a tropical cyclone should it move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. All three agencies that have assigned names to tropical cyclones within the Western Pacific have retired the names of significant tropical cyclones, with PAGASA retiring names if a cyclone has caused at least 7009100000000000000♠₱1 billion in damage and or have caused at least 300 deaths within the Philippines. Since 1963 the naming lists have been revised in 1979, 1985, 2001 and 2005 for various reasons including to help minimize confusion in the historical records and to remove the names that might have negative associations with real persons.[1][2] Within this list all information with regards to intensity is taken from while the system was in the Philippine area of responsibility and is thus taken from PAGASA's archives, rather than the JTWC or JMA's archives.


Pre 2000[edit]
Gathering of 10-minute sustained wind data had started in the 1978 Pacific typhoon season.
2000s[edit]
2010s[edit]
At the start of the decade the name Juan was retired after the 2010 season, after it had become a super typhoon and caused around 7009822346139500000♠₱8.22 billion in damages as it made landfall on Luzon. During 2011 the names Bebeng, Juaning, Mina, Pedring and Sendong were retired after each caused over 7009100000000000000♠₱1 billion in damages. In addition to causing over 7009100000000000000♠₱1 billion in damages, Tropical Storm Sendong and Typhoon Pablo caused over a thousand deaths. The name Katring was retired at the start of 2014 after a typhoon named Katring had affected the archipelago in 1994.[nb 5]
