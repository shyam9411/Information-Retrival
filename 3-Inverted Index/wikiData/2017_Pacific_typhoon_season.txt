2017 Pacific typhoon season
The 2017 Pacific typhoon season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season runs throughout 2017, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Muifa, developed on April 25. This season featured the latest occurrence of the first typhoon of the year since 1998, with Noru reaching this intensity on July 23.
The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and the 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin. PAGASA assigns unofficial names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility, located between 115°E–135°E and between 5°N–25°N, regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a numerical designation with a "W" suffix.


Seasonal forecast[edit]
During the year, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of University College London, PAGASA and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. The first forecast of the year was released by PAGASA during January 20, within its seasonal climate outlook for the period January – June.[4] The outlook noted that one to two tropical cyclones were expected between January and March, while two to four were expected to develop or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility between April and June.[4] During March 23, the Hong Kong Observatory predicted that the tropical cyclone season in Hong Kong would be near-normal, with four to seven tropical cyclones coming within 500 km (310 mi) of the territory compared to an average of six, which was revised to six to nine tropical cyclones in August.[7]
On May 5, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) issued their first forecast for the season, anticipating an activity of slightly above normal with 27 named storms, 17 typhoons and 10 intense typhoons, including an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) of 357.[1] On June 26, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB) predicted a normal season with 21—25 tropical storms developing over the basin, while three — five systems were expected to affect Taiwan itself.[5] In the same day, the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) predicted that 2 tropical cyclones would move towards the northern or northeastern parts of Thailand during August or September.[8] On July 6, TSR released their second forecast for the season, reducing the predicted numbers to 25 named storms, 15 typhoons and 7 intense typhoons, with an ACE Index of 250.[2] During the same day, the PAGASA issued their second and final outlook for the season for the period of July – December, where six to nine were expected to develop or entered their area of responsibility between July and September while three to five were forecast during October to December. During August 8, the TSR released their third and final forecast for the season, slightly raising their forecast named storms to 26, with 14 reaching typhoon intensity and 7 reaching intense typhoon intensity. ACE Indices were slightly raised to 255.[3]
Season summary[edit]
The Accumulated Cyclone Energy for the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, as of 12:00 UTC November 4, is 153.045 units.[nb 1]
The first half of the season was relatively inactive, with only seven systems developing, of which only two intensified into tropical storms. The first system of 2017 developed on January 7, and was named Auring by PAGASA. Tropical Depression Bising developed during the first week of February, and was a factor in, and worsened the effects of, the 2017 Visayas and Mindanao floods. This was followed by Crising, the third system unofficially named by PAGASA. Heavy rains from the depression caused flooding that led to the deaths of 10 people in Cebu, Philippines. Shortly after the dissipation of Crising came the formation of the first tropical storm of the season — Muifa. The system was not strong, however, and was located away from all major land areas, so it caused no damage. No systems formed during the month of May, the first such occurrence since 2013. The next cyclone, Merbok, formed during mid-June, and made landfall in Shenzhen in China. The cyclone was short-lived; however, it was relatively strong, producing winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) at its peak. Nanmadol passed over the Ryukyu Islands and progressed to make landfall in Nagasaki on Japan's island of Kyushu during early July. Torrential rainfall and strong winds from the cyclone itself and from the stormy weather that persisted for a number of days were responsible for moderate damage and at least 36 fatalities across mainland Japan.
By the middle of July, tropical activity had increased with simultaneous tropical storms developing after July 14. Severe Tropical Storm Talas formed during mid-July near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, and traveled generally westwards. It made landfall in Vietnam after brushing China's Hainan province and, unusually, continued to track far inland to the Laos–Thailand border before weakening to a depression. At least 14 deaths were attributed to the storm, primarily as a result of flooding. Later, the season was very active with 7 storms in late July-early August. Typhoon Noru reached category 5 super typhoon in peak intensity and made landfall in Japan, caused $55 million in total damage. Tropical Storm Sonca made landfall in Quảng Trị, Vietnam and it became July 2017 was the first month since July 1971 which has 2 storms made landfall in Central Vietnam in July. Sonca brought heavy rainfall in Northeast Thailand and caused extremely flooding in this region with total damage reached over $300 million. Typhoon Nesat and Tropical storm Haitang made landfall in Taiwan and Fujian, China in 2 days adjacrncy. In mid-late August, Typhoon Hato and Tropical Storm Pakhar made landfall in Macau and Guangdong while theo were at peak intensity. So far Typhoon Hato was the costliest tropical cyclone in Northwest Pacific in 2017 with total damage reached $4.31 billion.
The season begin weaker in September. Typhoon Talim made landfall in Japan as a strong typhoon and caused US$225 million in damage. Typhoon Doksuri made landfall in Quảng Bình, Vietnam as a category 3 typhoon, damage the typhoon caused was very major as total was estimated at over US$740 million. In early October a tropical depression made landfall in Northern and North Central Vietnam, it brought very heavy rainfall and it was responsible for the worst flooding in Northern and North-Central Vietnam. So far the depression was the deadliest tropical cyclone in Northwest Pacific in 2017 with 83 deaths and total damage reached over US$410 million. Later, typhoon Khanun made landfall in South China. So far typhoon Lan has been the strongest tropical cyclone in Northwest Pacific in 2017, and became the second largest tropical cyclone on record.
So far, the season was a weak season, with 22 storms, including 9 Typhoons and 2 super typhoons. The season was more active in South China Sea.
Systems[edit]
Tropical Depression 01W (Auring)[edit]
On January 7, both PAGASA and the JMA reported that Tropical Depression Auring developed about 400 km (250 mi) to the northeast of Davao City on Mindanao, Philippines.[9][10] During that day, the system moved along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge of high pressure, before the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Depression 01W.[11] It later made landfall in the Philippines the next day, and was assessed to have degenerated into a remnant low by the JTWC.[12] The JMA however tracked the system until it emerged into the South China Sea.[citation needed] By January 15, the JTWC re-issued advisories as it was located to the east of Vietnam.[13] However, convection dissipated due to wind shear and land interaction, the JTWC issued their final warnings on January 16.[14]
Flooding in Cebu killed one person.[15] Damages from Tropical Depression Auring were totaled at Ph₱7.14 million (US$140,000) from agriculture and fishing in Negros Occidental.[16]
Tropical Depression Bising[edit]
On February 3, a tropical depression developed near Palau.[17] The system dissipated on the 7th.[citation needed]
Tropical Depression 02W (Crising)[edit]
A tropical depression formed over Palau on April 13.[18] During the next 2 days, the system moved toward the Philippines
As of April 17, at least ten people were reported to be killed in Cebu by flooding caused by the system.[19] Total damages throughout the Philippines reached Ph₱84.8 million (US$1.7 million), mostly from Danao, Cebu.[20]
Tropical Storm Muifa (Dante)[edit]
During April 22, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed near Guam.[21] After moving westward for a couple of days, the JTWC began issuing advisories, and designated the storm 03W. By April 25, 03W organized and began consolidating further as the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Muifa.[21] Muifa entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility the following day, and was named Dante by PAGASA.[22] The storm, however, started moving northwards and immediately tracked out of the area by April 27. Following this, both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Muifa to a tropical depression. Muifa fully dissipated early on April 29, and the JMA issued their final advisory on the storm.[21]
Severe Tropical Storm Merbok[edit]
On June 10, the JMA started to track a tropical depression to the west of Manila, Philippines.[23] After the system entered a region favorable for further development, the depression rapidly organized, prompting the JTWC to start issuing advisories and give it the designation of 04W. A few hours later, 04W had intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name Merbok as it starts to move in a north-northwestward direction.[23] During June 12, Merbok reached its peak intensity with 10-minute winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and a minimum pressure of 985 hPa, shortly before making landfall in Eastern Shenzen.[23][24] On June 13, the JMA issued its final warning on Merbok, as the system dissipated over China.[24][23]
Sustained winds of 51.3 knots (95.0 km/h; 59.0 mph) and a minimum pressure of 990.3 hPa (29.24 inHg) were recorded in Hong Kong as the eye passed nearby.[24] Across Guangdong Province, 32 homes were destroyed, 122,000 people reported property damage, and 13,000 hectares of crops flooded. Merbok killed 5 people altogether in Mainland China, 1 from Guangdong and the other 4 were from Hunan.[25][26] Total economic losses reached CN¥516 million (US$76.7 million).[27][25]
Severe Tropical Storm Nanmadol (Emong)[edit]
On July 1, the JMA upgraded a low-pressure area it had been monitoring to a tropical depression, located south-southwest of Okinotorishima.[28] Later that day, the JMA began issuing advisories once the depression's sustained winds were estimated at 55 km/h (35 mph).[29] Shortly thereafter, the PAGASA classified the system as a tropical depression, assigning the local name Emong. On July 2, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm, and assigned the official name Nanmadol.[28] The JTWC followed suit and gave the internal designation of 05W. The cyclone continued to intensify, and was upgraded by the JMA to a severe tropical storm later that day.[28] Nanmadol reached peak intensity at about 06:00 UTC on July 3,[28] and maintained this strength until making landfall on the western coast of Kyushu several hours later. The cyclone began to accelerate while following a generally eastward course across the south of Japan. After brushing the southern coast of Japan, the JTWC issued its final advisory during the next day. The JMA followed suit late on July 4, when it had become extratropical.[28] Its remnants moved out of the basin three days later.[28]
Evacuation advisories were issued to at least 20,000 residents due to fears of possible flooding and landslides, especially in the prefectures of Niigata, Toyama and Nagano, which had experienced rainfall accumulations of up to 300 mm (12 in) in the preceding hours.[30][31] At least three people were injured during the storm—a young boy's hand was injured when a school window broke in the city of Kumamoto, and two adults in Oita prefecture sustained minor injuries after falling due to the strong winds.[30][31][32] As of July 13, a total of 30 people have been confirmed dead due to torrential rains which caused landslides and flooding, particularly in Kyushu.[33]
Severe Tropical Storm Talas[edit]
Early on July 14, the JMA upgraded a low-pressure area in the South China Sea to a tropical depression after the system began to organize.[34] Late the same day, the JMA began issuing advisories on the depression, and forecast it to develop into a tropical storm within the next 24 hours.[35]
Talas made landfall near Vinh of Nghệ An Province in Central Vietnam at 01:00 ICT on July 17 (18:00 UTC on July 16) as a severe tropical storm.[36] In Vietnam, the storm left 14 people dead and damaged around 2,700 houses. A coal ship with 13 crew members sank off the coast of Cửa Lò, leaving 3 dead and another 3 still unaccounted for.[37] Damages reached nearly 1 trillion₫ (US$43.7 million).[38] Despite making landfall in Vietnam, Talas caused a total of CNY 10.89 million(USD 1.64 million) ecomomic losses in Hainan.[39]
Typhoon Noru[edit]
The JMA reported that a non-tropical low had transitioned into a tropical depression north-northwest of Wake Island early on July 19.[40] Fluctuations in intensity occurred until late on July 29, when explosive intensification ensued. Damages of agriculture in Wakayama were counted to be JPY 600 million (USD 5.3 million).[41]
Tropical Storm Kulap[edit]
On July 20, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that formed over to the southwest of Midway Atoll, just to the west of the International Date Line.[42] The JTWC classified the system as subtropical, however.[43] By July 21, the subtropical storm started to show tropical characteristics, where it prompted both agencies to start issuing advisories, receiving the designation of 09W and the name Kulap.[44][42] During the next day, Kulap briefly reached its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) after imagery depicted some convection over near its compact center.[45] After moving westward in a marginally favorable environment, the JMA had reported a minimum pressure of 1002 hPa with peak 10-minute winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) during the early hours of July 24. However several hours later, Kulap had entered in a very unfavorable environment such as cooler waters of 25 °C (77 °F).[46] Due to strong shear and an interaction with Typhoon Noru to its south, Kulap had rapidly weakened; therefore, both agencies issued their final advisory on July 26.[47] The JMA, however, tracked Kulap's remnants until July 28 when it was absorbed by the outflow of Typhoon Noru.[42]
Tropical Storm Sonca[edit]
On July 21, both the JMA and the JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 08W had developed approximately 582 km (361 mi) to the south of Hong Kong.[48][49] After moving westward for a couple of days, the system strengthened into a tropical storm by both agencies while nearing the island province of Hainan, receiving the name Sonca.[50][48] By July 24, Sonca reached its maximum intensity with a minimum pressure of 994 hPa.[48] Early on July 25, the JTWC issued its final advisory as the system made landfall over in Quảng Trị Province, Vietnam.[51][52] The JMA issued its final advisory a few hours later when it had weakened into a tropical depression,[48] although Sonca maintained its intensity over land until it had fully dissipated on July 29.[48]
Flooding in Northern Cambodia drowned two people, blocked many roads and flooded several hundred houses.[53] Damage across Sakon Nakhon, Thailand exceeded 100 million baht (US$3 million)[54] and killed 23 people across Thailand.[55]
Tropical Storm Roke (Fabian)[edit]
The JMA noted the formation of a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan early on July 21.[56] Assigning the numerical designation 10W, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression at about 18:00 UTC the same day.[57] The system traveled in a generally northwesterly direction, and passed through the Luzon Strait, between Taiwan and the Philippines.[57] Around the same time, the PAGASA began issuing advisories on the depression, and contributed the unofficial name Fabian. Early the next day, after the system had emerged into the South China Sea, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Roke.[57][56] Roke assumed a more westerly course, and tracked obliquely towards China's Guangdong coast.[58] The JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical depression just 12 hours later, at 18:00 UTC,[57] but the JMA maintained the cyclone's category as a tropical storm. Roke made landfall just east of the Hong Kong central business district at about 01:30 UTC on July 23, and passed over Shenzhen one to two hours later.[58] Roke weakened to a depression a few hours later, though the JMA declared that it had dissipated on 18:00 UTC of the same day.[56]
Schools, businesses and government offices were closed in Hong Kong as the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) raised its typhoon warning signal to 8—the third highest of five levels—in preparation for Tropical Storm Roke.[59] Ferry services in the city were suspended, and more than 50 flights were delayed.[60] However, winds in the city were relatively light and no significant damage was reported.
Typhoon Nesat (Gorio)[edit]
The JMA upgraded a low-pressure area to a tropical depression east of the Philippines early on July 25.[61]
Despite the storm not making landfall over in the Philippines, Nesat enhanced the southwest monsoon which brought torrential rainfall over most of the country. As of July 30, the NDRRMC had reported a total of Php 105.02 million (US$2.08 million) worth of damages.[62] Total damages in Taiwan were counted to be NT$60 million(USD 2 million).[63] Total damages in Mainland China were counted to be CNY 760 million(USD 114 million).[64]
Tropical Storm Haitang (Huaning)[edit]
A low-pressure area over the northern portion of the South China Sea was upgraded to a tropical depression by the JMA early on July 27.[65] Despite an exposed LLCC with disorganized banding, the JTWC started initiating advisories, assigning the designation of 12W.[66] During the next day, the system had strengthened into a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it as Haitang, after ASCAT image depicted 40 knot winds over in the southern portion of the storm.[67] Due to the nearby Typhoon Nesat and moderate wind shear, Haitang maintained its intensity for several hours,[68] until on July 30 when the system had deepened and reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) with a minimum pressure of 985 hPa. Around the same time, Haitang entered the Philippine area of Responsibility, receiving the name Huaning by PAGASA, although the system had left the area during 12:00 UTC of the same day. Three hours later, the JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical depression,[69] though it was re-upgraded into a tropical storm six hours later.[70] By July 31, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Haitang after the system had made landfall over in the Pingtan County in Taiwan.[71] During 06:00 UTC of that day, the JMA issued their final advisory after Haitang weakened into a remnant low.[citation needed]
Tropical Storm Nalgae[edit]
During July 31, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression located about 1,106 km (687 mi) to the northeast of Wake Island.[72] During the next day, the JTWC started issuing advisories and designated it as 13W.[73] By August 2, both agencies upgraded 13W to Tropical Storm Nalgae after imagery showed flaring convection and the storm was located in a region of low to moderate wind shear and warm SSTs.[74][75] Moving in a northward direction, Nalgae slowly intensified for several days. Nalgae reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 85 km/h (55 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 988 hPa during August 5 for a brief time, as it was beginning to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The JTWC downgraded Nalgae to a tropical depression later that day and issued their final advisory after the storm was located in very unfavorable environments.[76] The JMA followed suit early on August 6 when Nalgae fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, after which its remnants moved further north and were last noted during August 9.[citation needed]
Typhoon Banyan[edit]
On August 11, a tropical depression had formed. The system then tracked north-west. On August 12th, the systems turned north and underwent intensification (and was named Banyan) until it reached its peak of category 2 at 140km/h (85mp/h) and a pressure of 970 hPa, the storm had not developed an eye wall fully yet. After heading north, the system was disrupted by moderate-strong wind shear caused the system to weaken back to a tropical depression, now tracking north-east. Banyan managed to strengthen again into category 2 (eye did not form here) but was again affected by wind shear and cooler waters, still tracking north-east. Then Banyan headed for Alaska as a tropical storm and before being extra tropical, it dissipated.[citation needed]
Typhoon Hato (Isang)[edit]
A low-pressure area developed into a tropical depression on August 19 while located to the southeast of Taiwan.[77]
It gradually intensified and reached typhoon status on the afternoon of August 22 after entering the northeastern part of the South China Sea. On August 23, 07:00 HKT, Hato was approximately 100 km southeast of Hong Kong, bringing rain to the mainland as well as Hainan to the west. At 11:00 HKT the eye was approximately 60 km southwest of Hong Kong with the typhoon heading onto the mainland in a west-northwesterly direction.[78]
Hong Kong Observatory issued Hurricane Signal No. 10 at 09:10 HKT, the first time since 2012.[79] A total of 26 people were killed while total damages in South China amounted to CN¥12.5 billion (US$1.87 billion).[80][81] Estimated damages in Hong Kong amounted to HK$8 billion (US$1.02 billion).[82] In Macau, losses of 11.47 billion patacas (US$1.42 billion) were incurred when high tides exacerbated flooding in most of the lower lying areas, inundating ground floor shops and businesses. There were twelve deaths as a result of the typhoon including a number of people who drowned in flooded underground car-parks.[83]
Severe Tropical Storm Pakhar (Jolina)[edit]
On August 26, Pakhar passed over the Philippines heading westward toward mainland China where it gathered strength before making landfall in Tianshan on August 27.
Total economic losses in South China have amounted to CN¥320 million (US$49 million) while a total of eight people have been killed so far as of August 29.[84] Moreover, damages in the Philippines were recorded at PhP41.27 million (US$808 thousand) and 2 billion₫ (US$85,000) in Vietnam.[85][86]
Typhoon Sanvu[edit]
On August 27, the JMA began to monitor a tropical depression that had developed about 441 km (274 mi) north-northeast of Saipan, although the system's nature was more of a monsoon depression.[87] The JTWC followed suit on the following day, designating the system as 17W.[88] Around the same time, the system had intensified into Tropical Storm Sanvu. By August 29, Sanvu increased in size, and therefore it prompted the JMA to upgrade it to a severe tropical storm. After moving in a westward direction, Sanvu stalled and entered a region of favorable conditions. As a ragged eye developed, both agencies upgraded Sanvu to a typhoon during August 31.[89] Sanvu reached its peak intensity on September 1 as a Category 2 typhoon.[90] Thereafter, the system steadily weakened as it started to move northwards with JTWC immediately downgrading the system to a tropical storm and issuing their final advisory late on September 2. The JMA still classified Sanvu as a typhoon until they issued their final advisory as the system had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 3.
Sanvu did not caused any significant damage in the Mariana Islands, though a 33-year-old woman drowned at Obyan beach due to large waves on August 29.[91]
Severe Tropical Storm Mawar[edit]
On August 30, the JMA started to track a tropical depression to the north-northeast of Luzon, Philippines. Given the international designation of 18W by the JTWC,[92] the JMA upgraded the system immediately to Tropical Storm Mawar. Slowly organizing, convection had rapidly developed and Mawar strengthened into a severe tropical storm early on September 2. On September 3, Mawar had weakened to a tropical storm after environments started to become unfavorable due to high wind shear.[93] Later that day, Mawar weakened to a tropical depression and the JTWC issued their final advisory while making landfall over in Southeastern China between the cities of Shanwei and Shantou.[94][95] The JMA followed suit early on September 4 when Mawar had fully dissipated.
The China's National Meteorological Center (NMC) issued a blue alert for the southern parts of Guangdong on September 1.[96] During 2:00 a.m. local time on September 2, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 1 over in Hong Kong.[97] Chinese authorities activated a natural disaster alert and response to help local civil affairs departments in areas such as the provinces of Fujian and Guandong to prepare for relief work.[98] By September 3, the NMC had raised their warning signal to a yellow alert.[99] Mawar did not cause any casualties or any major damages, though flooding was a major concern with reports of rainfall of up to 80 mm (3.1 in) in some places which were impacted by Hato and Pakhar.[95]
Tropical Storm Guchol (Kiko)[edit]
On September 3, the JMA started to track a tropical depression that had developed to the east of Luzon, Philippines. During the next day, the PAGASA initiated advisories and gave the local name Kiko,[100] while the JTWC followed suit by giving it the designation 19W.[101] However, due to increased wind shear along with an exposed circulation, the JTWC issued its final advisory on 03:00 UTC September 5.[102] Several hours later, deep convection was depicted and despite moderate to high shear, the JTWC re-initiated advisories,[103] while the JMA had upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it as Guchol early on the next day. On 21:00 UTC of that day, the JTWC stopped issuing warnings on the system after convection significantly weakened.[104] JMA later followed suit early in the next day by declaring it a remnant low as it neared Putian, Fujian on Strait of Taiwan. The remnant low would then make landfall over Pingtan County of Fujian in China late in the following day before it transitioned into an extratropical storm near Zhejiang as it merged with the cold front on September 8.[citation needed]
Typhoon Talim (Lannie)[edit]
A tropical depression formed east of Guam on September 7.[105] By the next day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 20W.[106] On September 9, 20W organized into a tropical storm, with the JMA naming the system as Talim.[107] With gradual intensification, the JMA upgraded Talim to a severe tropical storm. Talim further strengthened to a typhoon on September 11 where it simultaneously entered the PAR, with PAGASA naming it as Lannie.[108] The JTWC, however, delayed their upgrade until September 12.[109] Due to an ill-defined eye, Talim maintained its intensity until its eye became much clearer as rapid deepening ensued, as Talim became a Category 4 on September 14, and reached its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph).[110] Talim began to curve eastward as it rapidly weakened to a tropical storm thereafter, making landfall in Kyushu on September 17, with a path of heavy rainfall up to the region east of Tokyo.[111]
As of September 18, the death toll from Talim stands at two while 38 are injured.[112]Total economic losses in Hokkaido were counted to be 6.3 billion JPY(USD 55.7 miilion).[113] Total Aquaculture losses in Mainland Japan were counted to be JPY 100 million(USD 0.88 million).[114] Total agriculture losses in Mainland Japan were counted to be JPY 19.2 billion(USD 168.71 million).[115]
Typhoon Doksuri (Maring)[edit]
As of September 19, the NDRRMC confirmed a total of 8 dead due to landslides and flooding while total damages were up to Ph₱267 million (US$5.23 million).[116]
On September 15, Typhoon Doksuri made landfall in Quảng Bình Province, Vietnam as a Category 3 typhoon. Doksuri killed 15 people so far in Vietnam while estimated damages were about ₫16.36 trillion (US$720 million).[117][118][119] Despite making landfall in Indochina, Doksuri affected Hainan and total economic losses were estimated to be CNY 59 million(USD 8.96 million).[120]
Tropical Depression 22W (Nando)[edit]
A tropical depression formed to the west of Luzon on September 23, and was named "Nando" by PAGASA. The tropical depression quickly moved west-northwest and made landfall in Quảng Ninh, Vietnam, on September 25, before dissipating later on the same day.
The China Observatory issued a "yellow" alert over in the eastern and southern regions due to rainstorms. Some areas have warned a possible precipitation of about 140 mm (5.5 in).[121] Typhoon Signal No. 1 was raised over in Hong Kong during September 24, with expected gusts of up to 70 km/h (42 mph) including rough swells.[122] A voltage dip also occurred, causing 17 people to be trapped in lifts.[123] As the depression approached Vietnam on September 25, the Vietnam National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting of Vietnam forecast rainfall of about 150 mm (5.9 in) in Hanoi and surrounding provinces, with rough waves up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in Ha Long Bay.[124]
Tropical Depression 23W[edit]
Early on October 7, a tropical depression formed to the west of the Philippines.[125]
Early on October 10, the tropical depression made landfall in Hà Tĩnh Province, Vietnam, and dissipated shortly afterward. Consequently, both the JMA and the JTWC issued their final advisories for the storm.
Tropical Depression 23W caused severe flooding over provinces of Northern and Central Vietnam. Roughly more than 700 houses have been destroyed, while rescue efforts have saved 28 people from the danger zone. So far at least 83 people were killed, and damages were about 9.27 trillion₫ (US$409 million).[126][127] During October 10, the Red River was forecast to have waters exceed to the levels of 3–50 cm (2–20 in).[128][129] In Hoàng Long river (Ninh Bình Province) flooding was the most severe since 1985.[130]
Typhoon Khanun (Odette)[edit]
According to the NDRRMC, Khanun killed only one person, with total damages of Php4.45 million (US$86,400).[131] Total economic damages in Mainland China amounted to CNY 1.35 billion (USD 203.8 million), including 430 million CNY in Zhejiang province, 848 million CNY in Guangdong Province, 70 million in Hainan.[132][133][134] Authorities in Hong Kong and Macau raised the number 8 tropical cyclone warning on October 15 as gale-force winds affected the region.
Typhoon Lan (Paolo)[edit]
The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) initially mentioned a tropical disturbance over Chuuk on October 11.[135] After the slow consolidation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert to the elongated system early on October 14,[136] shortly after the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor it as a low-pressure area.[137] The agency upgraded it to a tropical depression almost one day later and began to issue tropical cyclone warnings since 06:00 UTC on October 15.[138][139] In the afternoon, the JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical depression assigning the designation 25W, which formative but shallow convective bands had become more organized, and symmetrically wrapped into a defined low-level circulation center.[140] About three hours later, the JMA upgraded it to the twenty-first Northwest Pacific tropical storm in 2017 and assigned the international name Lan, when it was located approximately 310 km (190 mi) to the northeast of Palau.[141] Early on October 16, the JTWC upgraded Lan to a tropical storm too, based on T-number 2.5 of the Dvorak technique,[142] shortly before it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and received the name Paolo from PAGASA.[143] Total economic losses from the communal facilities in Mainland Japan were counted to be JPY 13.748 billion (USD 120.53 million).[144][145] Total economic losses from the agriculture facilities in Mainland Japan were counted to be JPY 10.8 billion (USD 94.68 million).[146]
Tropical Depression 26W[edit]
Originating from an enhanced monsoon trough, a tropical disturbance developed just to the northwest of Palawan on October 17.[147] On October 18, the JTWC had issued a TCFA on the system.[148] By 21:00 UTC of that day, the JTWC began issuing advisories as they classified it as a tropical depression, assigning the identifier 26W.[149] This was due to deep convection found near the storm's center with formative banding, along with its location over in a favorable environment.[150] Initially, its forecast stated that 26W would intensify into a weak tropical storm, although due to a disorganized center with strong shear, the JTWC issued their final advisory on October 19 as it was being absorbed by the outflow of nearby Typhoon Lan.[151]
Associated with the rainbands of a nearby typhoon, 26W helped spread scattered rainfall throughout most of Visayas and northern Mindanao. Residents in some areas were alerted against possible flash floods and landslides.[152] 14 people were dead from heavy rainfall from the system and its precursor, and raised a state of calamity in Zamboanga City on October 23.[153][154]
Severe Tropical Storm Saola (Quedan)[edit]
A tropical depression formed north of Guam, the next day, the Tropical Depression transitioned into a Tropical Storm and the Japan Meteorological Agency named it Tropical Storm Saola. By evening of that day, Saola entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). The PAGASA gave the local name "Quedan" to the storm. By the next day, Saola moved slowly and strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Its intensity did not change, even as high wind shear occurred to the north of Saola and the strengthening northeast monsoon while heading to Japan. It started weakening while in cold waters and brought rains to Southern Japan but did not make landfall. It dissipated after avoiding Japan and heading northeast.
Typhoon Damrey (Ramil)[edit]
The JMA upgraded a low-pressure area to a tropical depression east of Visayas on October 31. PAGASA gave warnings to the system and named it Ramil. The storm brought rainy weather on the All Saints's Day (November 1) to Visayas. The tropical depression made landfall over Busuanga, Palawan at midnight on November 1. On November 2, Ramil strengthened, and the JTWC and JMA upgraded Ramil to a tropical storm, and gave the system the international name Damrey.[155]
As of November 5, a total of 27 people were confirmed dead, due to the storm.[156]
Other systems[edit]
On March 19, a tropical depression formed close to the northeast of Mindanao, Philippines, and dissipated over the Sibuyan Sea two days later.[157][158] Early on June 29, the JMA initiated advisories on a newly formed tropical depression located about 138 km (86 mi) south of Okinawa Island.[159] The system re-curved and started moving in a northeastward direction until it dissipated to the southwest of Tokyo on July 1.[160] Early on July 4, the JMA indicated that a tropical depression had formed about 505 km (314 mi) south of Okinotorishima.[161] During the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system, although it was canceled several hours later.[162] After moving northward, the depression rapidly weakened as it was absorbed by a stationary front on July 7.[163]
Early on July 13, the JMA reported that a non-tropical low had transitioned into a tropical depression about 72 km (45 mi) north-northeast of Iwo Jima.[164] The depression moved in a generally northeasterly direction until weakening to a low-pressure area by 06:00 UTC on July 16.[165] A tropical depression formed about 691 km (429 mi) northeast of Wake Island late on July 25, though the JTWC indicated it as a subtropical system with estimated recorded winds of 65 km/h (40 mph).[166][167] After several days, the system had already transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 29, without becoming a tropical storm.[168] Early on August 25 the JMA started to track a tropical depression over in the South China Sea,[169] although it was last monitored during the next day when it was absorbed by the outflow of Tropical Storm Pakhar.[170] On August 28, the JMA started to issue advisories on a tropical depression that had developed about 1,217 km (756 mi) east-northeast of Tuguegarao City.[171] The JMA predicted that the system would become a tropical storm within the next 24 hours, although because the system did not develop further, the JMA issued their final advisory on 03:00 UTC of August 29 when the system had weakened into a low-pressure area.[172] The remnants of the system helped with formation of Tropical Storm Mawar.[173]
The JMA upgraded a low-pressure area to a tropical depression over the southern portion of the South China sea on October 30.[174] The JTWC issued a TCFA during the next day as it gathered strength. Initially predicting to intensify to a tropical storm, the system rapidly deteriorated and degenerated to a remnant low on November 3 and went to Gulf of Thailand.[175]
Storm names[edit]
Within the Northwest Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and PAGASA assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names.[176] The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph).[177] PAGASA assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E–115°E and between 5°N–25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it.[176] The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee.[177] Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season. Unused names are marked in gray.
International names[edit]
A tropical cyclone is named when it is judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph).[178] The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee.[179] Retired names, if any, will be announced by the WMO in 2018; though replacement names will be announced in 2019. The next 28 names on the naming list are listed here along with their international numeric designation, if they are used. During the season the names Hato and Lan were used for the first time, after it replaced the names Washi and Vicente, which was retired after the 2011 and 2012 seasons.
Philippines[edit]
This season, PAGASA will use its own naming scheme for cyclones, that will either develop within or move into their self-defined area of responsibility.[180] The names were taken from a list of names, that was last used during 2013 and are scheduled to be used again during 2021.[180] All of the names are the same except for Lannie, Salome and Yasmin, which replaced the names Labuyo, Santi and Yolanda after they were retired.[180] The name Lannie was used for the first time this year.
Season effects[edit]
This table summarizes all the systems that developed within or moved into the northern Pacific Ocean, to the west of the International Date Line during 2017. The tables also provide an overview of a systems intensity, duration, land areas affected and any deaths or damages associated with the system.
