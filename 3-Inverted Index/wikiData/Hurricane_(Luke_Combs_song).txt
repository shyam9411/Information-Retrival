Hurricane (Luke Combs song)
"Hurricane" is the debut single of American country music singer Luke Combs. The song was released through Columbia Records in 2016 after initially charting in 2015. It is included on his debut album This One's for You.[1] The song is about comparing an ex-girlfriend to a natural disaster.
"Hurricane" reached number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart. Its second week atop that position gave Combs two distinctions: the first artist to have a multi-week number one debut single chart since Florida Georgia Line's "Cruise" in 2012 and the first male solo artist to accomplish that since Darius Rucker's "Don't Think I Don't Think About It" in 2008. It also peaked at numbers 3 and 31 on both the Hot Country Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively. The song received a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 604,000 copies in the United States as of September 2017. It garnered similar chart success in Canada, reaching number 2 on the Canada Country chart and number 62 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.


Content[edit]
The song is about the narrator's former lover, whom he encounters unexpectedly and compares to the damage done by a hurricane.[2] Rolling Stone describes the song's arrangement as "an accidental combination of new school and Nineties-era country that freely mixes electronic beats".[3]
Scott Moffatt, of The Moffatts produced the song.[3]
Critical reception[edit]
Billy Dukes of Taste of Country reviewed the song with favor, saying "The singer proves heâ€™s a strong storyteller, but also a stylist, with a complex chorus that allows a mainstream production to pop from the speakers."[2]
