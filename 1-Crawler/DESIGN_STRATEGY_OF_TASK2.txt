DESIGN STRATEGY
QUESTION ANALYSIS: The task2 require us to match the cognates and synonyms of keyword in the urls or anchor text without considering capitals. Return at most 1000 urls that match the keyword.

ANSWER: 
We use Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to conduct the process of finding synonyms and stemming. 
1.First, we need to split a url into several independent words by extract_words_from_url. 
2.In function find_stemming_sets, the Lancaster stemmer find all cognates for given world list by Lancaster stemming algorithm. 
3.Function find_synonym_sets will find all synonyms of keyword based on NLTKâ€™s word net.
lemmas() returns all synonyms under different POS.
4.Then we only need to judge whether (wordlist + cognates of wordlist) and (keyword + synonyms of keyword) have intersection by function is_synonym_word.
5.In the crawling process, if a url has matched the given keyword, it will be pushed in our frontier. Else it will be abandoned (line 86-88 in source code). 

PS: This program may take a pretty long execution time since the crawlers need to search until 6th depth at most cases.
